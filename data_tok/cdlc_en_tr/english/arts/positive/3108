I	'd	like	to	begin	this	song	I	wrote	about	ceaseless	yearning	and	never-ending	want	with	a	poem	of	popular	Petrarchan	paradoxes	by	Sir	Thomas	Wyatt	the	Elder	:	``	I	find	no	peace	,	and	all	my	war	is	done	;	I	fear	and	hope	,	I	burn	and	freeze	like	ice	;	I	fly	above	the	wind	,	and	yet	I	can	not	arise	;	And	naught	I	have	,	and	all	the	world	I	seize	upon	.

Shea	Hembrey	:	How	I	became	100	artists
I	'm	a	contemporary	artist	with	a	bit	of	an	unexpected	background	.
I	was	in	my	20s	before	I	ever	went	to	an	art	museum	.
I	grew	up	in	the	middle	of	nowhere	on	a	dirt	road	in	rural	Arkansas	,	an	hour	from	the	nearest	movie	theater	.
And	I	think	it	was	a	great	place	to	grow	up	as	an	artist	because	I	grew	up	around	quirky	,	colorful	characters	who	were	great	at	making	with	their	hands	.
And	my	childhood	is	more	hick	than	I	could	ever	possibly	relate	to	you	,	and	also	more	intellectual	than	you	would	ever	expect	.
For	instance	,	me	and	my	sister	,	when	we	were	little	,	we	would	compete	to	see	who	could	eat	the	most	squirrel	brains	.
But	on	the	other	side	of	that	,	though	,	we	were	big	readers	in	our	house	.
And	if	the	TV	was	on	,	we	were	watching	a	documentary	.
And	my	dad	is	the	most	voracious	reader	I	know	.
He	can	read	a	novel	or	two	a	day	.
But	when	I	was	little	,	I	remember	,	he	would	kill	flies	in	our	house	with	my	BB	gun	.
And	what	was	so	amazing	to	me	about	that	--	well	he	would	be	in	his	recliner	,	would	holler	for	me	to	fetch	the	BB	gun	,	and	I	'd	go	get	it	.
And	what	was	amazing	to	me	--	well	it	was	pretty	kickass	;	he	was	killing	a	fly	in	the	house	with	a	gun	--	but	what	was	so	amazing	to	me	was	that	he	knew	just	enough	how	to	pump	it	.
And	he	could	shoot	it	from	two	rooms	away	and	not	damage	what	it	was	on	because	he	knew	how	to	pump	it	just	enough	to	kill	the	fly	and	not	damage	what	it	landed	on	.
So	I	should	talk	about	art	.
Or	we	'll	be	here	all	day	with	my	childhood	stories	.
I	love	contemporary	art	,	but	I	'm	often	really	frustrated	with	the	contemporary	art	world	and	the	contemporary	art	scene	.
A	few	years	ago	,	I	spent	months	in	Europe	to	see	the	major	international	art	exhibitions	that	have	the	pulse	of	what	is	supposed	to	be	going	on	in	the	art	world	.
And	I	was	struck	by	going	to	so	many	,	one	after	the	other	,	with	some	clarity	of	what	it	was	that	I	was	longing	for	.
And	I	was	longing	for	several	things	that	I	was	n't	getting	,	or	not	getting	enough	of	.
But	two	of	the	main	things	:	one	of	it	,	I	was	longing	for	more	work	that	was	appealing	to	a	broad	public	,	that	was	accessible	.
And	the	second	thing	that	I	was	longing	for	was	some	more	exquisite	craftsmanship	and	technique	.
So	I	started	thinking	and	listing	what	all	it	was	that	I	thought	would	make	a	perfect	biennial	.
So	I	decided	,	I	'm	going	to	start	my	own	biennial	.
I	'm	going	to	organize	it	and	direct	it	and	get	it	going	in	the	world	.
So	I	thought	,	okay	,	I	have	to	have	some	criteria	of	how	to	choose	work	.
So	amongst	all	the	criteria	I	have	,	there	's	two	main	things	.
One	of	them	,	I	call	my	Mimaw	's	Test	.
And	what	that	is	is	I	imagine	explaining	a	work	of	art	to	my	grandmother	in	five	minutes	,	and	if	I	ca	n't	explain	it	in	five	minutes	,	then	it	's	too	obtuse	or	esoteric	and	it	has	n't	been	refined	enough	yet	.
It	needs	to	worked	on	until	it	can	speak	fluently	.
And	then	my	other	second	set	of	rules	--	I	hate	to	say	``	rules	''	because	it	's	art	--	my	criteria	would	be	the	three	H	's	,	which	is	head	,	heart	and	hands	.
And	great	art	would	have	``	head	''	:	it	would	have	interesting	intellectual	ideas	and	concepts	.
It	would	have	``	heart	''	in	that	it	would	have	passion	and	heart	and	soul	.
And	it	would	have	``	hand	''	in	that	it	would	be	greatly	crafted	.
So	I	started	thinking	about	how	am	I	going	to	do	this	biennial	,	how	am	I	going	to	travel	the	world	and	find	these	artists	?
And	then	I	realized	one	day	,	there	's	an	easier	solution	to	this	.
I	'm	just	going	to	make	the	whole	thing	myself	.
And	so	this	is	what	I	did	.
So	I	thought	,	a	biennial	needs	artists	.
I	'm	going	to	do	an	international	biennial	;	I	need	artists	from	all	around	the	world	.
So	what	I	did	was	I	invented	a	hundred	artists	from	around	the	world	.
I	figured	out	their	bios	,	their	passions	in	life	and	their	art	styles	,	and	I	started	making	their	work	.
I	felt	,	oh	this	is	the	kind	of	project	that	I	could	spend	my	whole	life	doing	.
So	I	decided	,	I	'm	going	to	make	this	a	real	biennial	.
It	's	going	to	be	two	years	of	studio	work	.
And	I	'm	going	to	create	this	in	two	years	,	and	I	have	.
So	I	should	start	to	talk	about	these	guys	.
Well	the	range	is	quite	a	bit	.
And	I	'm	such	a	technician	,	so	I	loved	this	project	,	getting	to	play	with	all	the	techniques	.
So	for	example	,	in	realist	paintings	,	it	ranges	from	this	,	which	is	kind	of	old	masters	style	,	to	really	realistic	still-life	,	to	this	type	of	painting	where	I	'm	painting	with	a	single	hair	.
And	then	at	the	other	end	,	there	's	performance	and	short	films	and	indoor	installations	like	this	indoor	installation	and	this	one	,	and	outdoor	installations	like	this	one	and	this	one	.
I	know	I	should	mention	:	I	'm	making	all	these	things	.
This	is	n't	Photoshopped	.
I	'm	under	the	river	with	those	fish	.
So	now	let	me	introduce	some	of	my	fictional	artists	to	you	.
This	is	Nell	Remmel	.
Nell	is	interested	in	agricultural	processes	,	and	her	work	is	based	in	these	practices	.
This	piece	,	which	is	called	``	Flipped	Earth	''	--	she	was	interested	in	taking	the	sky	and	using	it	to	cleanse	barren	ground	.
And	by	taking	giant	mirrors	--	and	here	she	's	taking	giant	mirrors	and	pulling	them	into	the	dirt	.
And	this	is	22	feet	long	.
And	what	I	loved	about	her	work	is	,	when	I	would	walk	around	it	and	look	down	into	the	sky	,	looking	down	to	watch	the	sky	,	and	it	unfolded	in	a	new	way	.
And	probably	the	best	part	of	this	piece	is	at	dusk	and	dawn	when	the	twilight	wedge	has	fallen	and	the	ground	's	dark	,	but	there	's	still	the	light	above	,	bright	above	.
And	so	you	're	standing	there	and	everything	else	is	dark	,	but	there	's	this	portal	that	you	want	to	jump	in	.
This	piece	was	great	.	This	is	in	my	parents	'	backyard	in	Arkansas	.
And	I	love	to	dig	a	hole	.
So	this	piece	was	great	fun	because	it	was	two	days	of	digging	in	soft	dirt	.
The	next	artist	is	Kay	Overstry	,	and	she	's	interested	in	ephemerality	and	transience	.
And	in	her	most	recent	project	,	it	's	called	``	Weather	I	Made	.	''
And	she	's	making	weather	on	her	body	's	scale	.
And	this	piece	is	``	Frost	.	''
And	what	she	did	was	she	went	out	on	a	cold	,	dry	night	and	breathed	back	and	forth	on	the	lawn	to	leave	--	to	leave	her	life	's	mark	,	the	mark	of	her	life	.
And	so	this	is	five-foot	,	five-inches	of	frost	that	she	left	behind	.
The	sun	rises	,	and	it	melts	away	.
And	that	was	played	by	my	mom	.
So	the	next	artist	,	this	is	a	group	of	Japanese	artists	,	a	collective	of	Japanese	artists	--	in	Tokyo	.
And	they	were	interested	in	developing	a	new	,	alternative	art	space	,	and	they	needed	funding	for	it	,	so	they	decided	to	come	up	with	some	interesting	fundraising	projects	.
One	of	these	is	scratch-off	masterpieces	.
And	so	what	they	're	doing	--	each	of	these	artists	on	a	nine-by-seven-inch	card	,	which	they	sell	for	10	bucks	,	they	drew	original	works	of	art	.
And	you	buy	one	,	and	maybe	you	get	a	real	piece	,	and	maybe	not	.
Well	this	has	sparked	a	craze	in	Japan	,	because	everyone	's	wanting	a	masterpiece	.
And	the	ones	that	are	the	most	sought	after	are	the	ones	that	are	only	barely	scratched	off	.
And	all	these	works	,	in	some	way	,	talk	about	luck	or	fate	or	chance	.
Those	first	two	are	portraits	of	mega-jackpot	winners	years	before	and	after	their	win	.
And	in	this	one	it	's	called	``	Drawing	the	Short	Stick	.	''
I	love	this	piece	because	I	have	a	little	cousin	at	home	who	introduced	me	--	which	I	think	is	such	a	great	introduction	--	to	a	friend	one	day	as	,	``	This	is	my	cousin	Shea	.
He	draws	sticks	real	good	.	''
Which	is	one	of	the	best	compliments	ever	.
This	artist	is	Gus	Weinmueller	,	and	he	's	doing	a	project	,	a	large	project	,	called	``	Art	for	the	Peoples	.	''
And	within	this	project	,	he	's	doing	a	smaller	project	called	``	Artists	in	Residence	.	''
And	what	he	does	is	--	he	spends	a	week	at	a	time	with	a	family	.
And	he	shows	up	on	their	porch	,	their	doorstep	,	with	a	toothbrush	and	pajamas	,	and	he	's	ready	to	spend	the	week	with	them	.
And	using	only	what	's	present	,	he	goes	in	and	makes	a	little	abode	studio	to	work	out	of	.
And	he	spends	that	week	talking	to	the	family	about	what	do	they	think	great	art	is	.
He	has	all	these	discussions	with	their	family	,	and	he	digs	through	everything	they	have	,	and	he	finds	materials	to	make	work	.
And	he	makes	a	work	that	answers	what	they	think	great	art	is	.
For	this	family	,	he	made	this	still-life	painting	.
And	whatever	he	makes	somehow	references	nesting	and	space	and	personal	property	.
This	next	project	,	this	is	by	Jaochim	Parisvega	,	and	he	's	interested	in	--	he	believes	art	is	everywhere	waiting	--	that	it	just	needs	a	little	bit	of	a	push	to	happen	.
And	he	provides	this	push	by	harnessing	natural	forces	,	like	in	his	series	where	he	used	rain	to	make	paintings	.
This	project	is	called	``	Love	Nests	.	''
What	he	did	was	to	get	wild	birds	to	make	his	art	for	him	.
So	he	put	the	material	in	places	where	the	birds	were	going	to	collect	them	,	and	they	crafted	his	nests	for	him	.
And	this	one	's	called	``	Lovelock	's	Nest	.	''
This	one	's	called	``	Mixtape	Love	Song	's	Nest	.	''
And	this	one	's	called	``	Lovemaking	Nest	.	''
Next	is	Sylvia	Slater	.
Sylvia	's	interested	in	art	training	.
She	's	a	very	serious	Swiss	artist	.
And	she	was	thinking	about	her	friends	and	family	who	work	in	chaos-ridden	places	and	developing	countries	,	and	she	was	thinking	,	what	can	I	make	that	would	be	of	value	to	them	,	in	case	something	bad	happens	and	they	have	to	buy	their	way	across	the	border	or	pay	off	a	gunman	?
And	so	she	came	up	with	creating	these	pocket-sized	artworks	that	are	portraits	of	the	person	that	would	carry	them	.
And	you	would	carry	this	around	with	you	,	and	if	everything	went	to	hell	,	you	could	make	payments	and	buy	your	life	.
So	this	life	price	is	for	an	irrigation	non-profit	director	.
So	hopefully	what	happens	is	you	never	use	it	,	and	it	's	an	heirloom	that	you	pass	down	.
And	she	makes	them	so	they	could	either	be	broken	up	into	payments	,	or	they	could	be	like	these	,	which	are	leaves	that	can	be	payments	.
And	so	they	're	valuable	.	This	is	precious	metals	and	gemstones	.
And	this	one	had	to	get	broken	up	.
He	had	to	break	off	a	piece	to	get	out	of	Egypt	recently	.
This	is	by	a	duo	,	Michael	Abernathy	and	Bud	Holland	.
And	they	're	interested	in	creating	culture	,	just	tradition	.
So	what	they	do	is	they	move	into	an	area	and	try	to	establish	a	new	tradition	in	a	small	geographic	area	.
So	this	is	in	Eastern	Tennessee	,	and	what	they	decided	was	that	we	need	a	positive	tradition	that	goes	with	death	.
So	they	came	up	with	``	dig	jigs	.	''
And	a	dig	jig	--	a	dig	jig	is	where	,	for	a	milestone	anniversary	or	a	birthday	,	you	gather	all	your	friends	and	family	together	and	you	dance	on	where	you	're	going	to	be	buried	.
And	we	got	a	lot	of	attention	when	we	did	it	.
I	talked	my	family	into	doing	this	,	and	they	did	n't	know	what	I	was	doing	.
And	I	was	like	,	``	Get	dressed	for	a	funeral	.	We	're	going	to	go	do	some	work	.	''
And	so	we	got	to	the	grave	and	made	this	,	which	was	hilarious	--	the	attention	that	we	got	.
So	what	happens	is	you	dance	on	the	grave	,	and	after	you	've	done	your	dance	,	everyone	toasts	you	and	tells	you	how	great	you	are	.
And	you	in	essence	have	a	funeral	that	you	get	to	be	present	for	.
That	's	my	mom	and	dad	.
This	is	by	Jason	Birdsong	.
He	is	interested	in	how	we	see	as	an	animal	,	how	we	are	interested	in	mimicry	and	camouflage	.
You	know	,	we	look	down	a	dark	alley	or	a	jungle	path	,	trying	to	make	out	a	face	or	a	creature	.
We	just	have	that	natural	way	of	seeing	.
And	he	plays	with	this	idea	.
And	this	piece	:	those	are	n't	actually	leaves	.
They	're	butterfly	specimens	who	have	a	natural	camouflage	.
So	he	pairs	these	up	.
There	's	another	pile	of	leaves	.
Those	are	actually	all	real	butterfly	specimens	.
And	he	pairs	these	up	with	paintings	.
Like	this	is	a	painting	of	a	snake	in	a	box	.
So	you	open	the	box	and	you	think	,	``	Whoa	,	there	's	a	snake	in	there	.	''
But	it	's	actually	a	painting	.
So	he	makes	these	interesting	conversations	about	realism	and	mimicry	and	our	drive	to	be	fooled	by	great	camouflage	.
The	next	artist	is	Hazel	Clausen	.
Hazel	Clausen	is	an	anthropologist	who	took	a	sabbatical	and	decided	,	``	You	know	,	I	would	learn	a	lot	about	culture	if	I	created	a	culture	that	does	n't	exist	from	scratch	.	''
So	that	's	what	she	did	.
She	created	the	Swiss	people	named	the	Uvulites	,	and	they	have	this	distinctive	yodeling	song	that	they	use	the	uvula	for	.
And	also	they	reference	how	the	uvula	--	everything	they	say	is	fallen	because	of	the	forbidden	fruit	.
And	that	's	the	symbol	of	their	culture	.
And	this	is	from	a	documentary	called	``	Sexual	Practices	and	Populations	Control	Among	the	Uvulites	.	''
This	is	a	typical	angora	embroidery	for	them	.
This	is	one	of	their	founders	,	Gert	Schaeffer	.
And	actually	this	is	my	Aunt	Irene	.
It	was	so	funny	having	a	fake	person	who	was	making	fake	things	.
And	I	crack	up	at	this	piece	,	because	when	I	see	it	I	know	that	's	French	angora	and	all	antique	German	ribbons	and	wool	that	I	got	in	a	Nebraska	mill	and	carried	around	for	10	years	and	then	antique	Chinese	skirts	.
The	next	is	a	collective	of	artists	called	the	Silver	Dobermans	,	and	their	motto	is	to	spread	pragmatism	one	person	at	a	time	.
And	they	're	really	interested	in	how	over-coddled	we	've	become	.
So	this	is	one	of	their	comments	on	how	over-coddled	we	've	become	.
And	what	they	've	done	is	they	put	a	warning	sign	on	every	single	barb	on	this	fence	.
And	this	is	called	``	Horse	Sense	Fence	.	''
The	next	artist	is	K.	M.	Yoon	,	a	really	interesting	South	Korean	artist	.
And	he	's	reworking	a	Confucian	art	tradition	of	scholar	stones	.
Next	is	Maynard	Sipes	.
And	I	love	Maynard	Sipes	,	but	he	's	off	in	his	own	world	,	and	,	bless	his	heart	,	he	's	so	paranoid	.
Next	is	Roy	Penig	,	a	really	interesting	Kentucky	artist	,	and	he	's	the	nicest	guy	.
He	even	once	traded	a	work	of	art	for	a	block	of	government	cheese	because	the	person	wanted	it	so	badly	.
Next	is	an	Australian	artist	,	Janeen	Jackson	,	and	this	is	from	a	project	of	hers	called	``	What	an	Artwork	Does	When	We	're	Not	Watching	.	''
Next	is	by	a	Lithuanian	fortune	teller	,	Jurgi	Petrauskas	.
Next	is	Ginger	Cheshire	.
This	is	from	a	short	film	of	hers	called	``	The	Last	Person	.	''
And	that	's	my	cousin	and	my	sister	's	dog	,	Gabby	.
The	next	,	this	is	by	Sam	Sandy	.
He	's	an	Australian	Aboriginal	elder	,	and	he	's	also	an	artist	.
And	this	is	from	a	large	traveling	sculpture	project	that	he	's	doing	.
This	is	from	Estelle	Willoughsby	.
She	heals	with	color	.
And	she	's	one	of	the	most	prolific	of	all	these	hundred	artists	,	even	though	she	's	going	to	be	90	next	year	.
This	is	by	Z.	Zhou	,	and	he	's	interested	in	stasis	.
Next	is	by	Hilda	Singh	,	and	she	's	doing	a	whole	project	called	``	Social	Outfits	.	''
Next	is	by	Vera	Sokolova	.
And	I	have	to	say	,	Vera	kind	of	scares	me	.
You	ca	n't	look	her	directly	in	the	eyes	because	she	's	kind	of	scary	.
And	it	's	good	that	she	's	not	real	;	she	'd	be	mad	that	I	said	that	.
And	she	's	an	optometrist	in	St.	Petersburg	,	and	she	plays	with	optics	.
Next	,	this	is	by	Thomas	Swifton	.
This	is	from	a	short	film	,	``	Adventures	with	Skinny	.	''
And	this	is	by	Cicily	Bennett	,	and	it	's	from	a	series	of	short	films	.
And	after	this	one	,	there	's	77	other	artists	.
And	all	together	with	those	other	77	you	're	not	seeing	,	that	's	my	biennial	.
Thank	you	.	Thank	you	.
Thanks	.
Thank	you	.	Thanks	.

Robert	Lang	is	a	pioneer	of	the	newest	kind	of	origami	--	using	math	and	engineering	principles	to	fold	mind-blowingly	intricate	designs	that	are	beautiful	and	,	sometimes	,	very	useful	.

Robert	Lang	folds	way-new	origami
My	talk	is	``	Flapping	Birds	and	Space	Telescopes	.	''
And	you	would	think	that	should	have	nothing	to	do	with	one	another	,	but	I	hope	by	the	end	of	these	18	minutes	,	you	'll	see	a	little	bit	of	a	relation	.
It	ties	to	origami	.	So	let	me	start	.
What	is	origami	?
Most	people	think	they	know	what	origami	is	.	It	's	this	:	flapping	birds	,	toys	,	cootie	catchers	,	that	sort	of	thing	.
And	that	is	what	origami	used	to	be	.
But	it	's	become	something	else	.
It	's	become	an	art	form	,	a	form	of	sculpture	.
The	common	theme	--	what	makes	it	origami	--	is	folding	is	how	we	create	the	form	.
You	know	,	it	's	very	old	.	This	is	a	plate	from	1797	.
It	shows	these	women	playing	with	these	toys	.
If	you	look	close	,	it	's	this	shape	,	called	a	crane	.
Every	Japanese	kid	learns	how	to	fold	that	crane	.
So	this	art	has	been	around	for	hundreds	of	years	,	and	you	would	think	something	that	's	been	around	that	long	--	so	restrictive	,	folding	only	--	everything	that	could	be	done	has	been	done	a	long	time	ago	.
And	that	might	have	been	the	case	.
But	in	the	twentieth	century	,	a	Japanese	folder	named	Yoshizawa	came	along	,	and	he	created	tens	of	thousands	of	new	designs	.
But	even	more	importantly	,	he	created	a	language	,	a	way	we	could	communicate	,	a	code	of	dots	,	dashes	and	arrows	.
Harkening	back	to	Susan	Blackmore	's	talk	,	we	now	have	a	means	of	transmitting	information	with	heredity	and	selection	,	and	we	know	where	that	leads	.
And	where	it	has	led	in	origami	is	to	things	like	this	.
This	is	an	origami	figure	--	one	sheet	,	no	cuts	,	folding	only	,	hundreds	of	folds	.
This	,	too	,	is	origami	,	and	this	shows	where	we	've	gone	in	the	modern	world	.
Naturalism	.	Detail	.
You	can	get	horns	,	antlers	--	even	,	if	you	look	close	,	cloven	hooves	.
And	it	raises	a	question	:	what	changed	?
And	what	changed	is	something	you	might	not	have	expected	in	an	art	,	which	is	math	.
That	is	,	people	applied	mathematical	principles	to	the	art	,	to	discover	the	underlying	laws	.
And	that	leads	to	a	very	powerful	tool	.
The	secret	to	productivity	in	so	many	fields	--	and	in	origami	--	is	letting	dead	people	do	your	work	for	you	.
Because	what	you	can	do	is	take	your	problem	,	and	turn	it	into	a	problem	that	someone	else	has	solved	,	and	use	their	solutions	.
And	I	want	to	tell	you	how	we	did	that	in	origami	.
Origami	revolves	around	crease	patterns	.
The	crease	pattern	shown	here	is	the	underlying	blueprint	for	an	origami	figure	.
And	you	ca	n't	just	draw	them	arbitrarily	.
They	have	to	obey	four	simple	laws	.
And	they	're	very	simple	,	easy	to	understand	.
The	first	law	is	two-colorability	.	You	can	color	any	crease	pattern	with	just	two	colors	without	ever	having	the	same	color	meeting	.
The	directions	of	the	folds	at	any	vertex	--	the	number	of	mountain	folds	,	the	number	of	valley	folds	--	always	differs	by	two	.	Two	more	or	two	less	.
Nothing	else	.
If	you	look	at	the	angles	around	the	fold	,	you	find	that	if	you	number	the	angles	in	a	circle	,	all	the	even-numbered	angles	add	up	to	a	straight	line	,	all	the	odd-numbered	angles	add	up	to	a	straight	line	.
And	if	you	look	at	how	the	layers	stack	,	you	'll	find	that	no	matter	how	you	stack	folds	and	sheets	,	a	sheet	can	never	penetrate	a	fold	.
So	that	's	four	simple	laws	.	That	's	all	you	need	in	origami	.
All	of	origami	comes	from	that	.
And	you	'd	think	,	``	Can	four	simple	laws	give	rise	to	that	kind	of	complexity	?	''
But	indeed	,	the	laws	of	quantum	mechanics	can	be	written	down	on	a	napkin	,	and	yet	they	govern	all	of	chemistry	,	all	of	life	,	all	of	history	.
If	we	obey	these	laws	,	we	can	do	amazing	things	.
So	in	origami	,	to	obey	these	laws	,	we	can	take	simple	patterns	--	like	this	repeating	pattern	of	folds	,	called	textures	--	and	by	itself	it	's	nothing	.
But	if	we	follow	the	laws	of	origami	,	we	can	put	these	patterns	into	another	fold	that	itself	might	be	something	very	,	very	simple	,	but	when	we	put	it	together	,	we	get	something	a	little	different	.
This	fish	,	400	scales	--	again	,	it	is	one	uncut	square	,	only	folding	.
And	if	you	do	n't	want	to	fold	400	scales	,	you	can	back	off	and	just	do	a	few	things	,	and	add	plates	to	the	back	of	a	turtle	,	or	toes	.
Or	you	can	ramp	up	and	go	up	to	50	stars	on	a	flag	,	with	13	stripes	.
And	if	you	want	to	go	really	crazy	,	1,000	scales	on	a	rattlesnake	.
And	this	guy	's	on	display	downstairs	,	so	take	a	look	if	you	get	a	chance	.
The	most	powerful	tools	in	origami	have	related	to	how	we	get	parts	of	creatures	.
And	I	can	put	it	in	this	simple	equation	.
We	take	an	idea	,	combine	it	with	a	square	,	and	you	get	an	origami	figure	.
What	matters	is	what	we	mean	by	those	symbols	.
And	you	might	say	,	``	Can	you	really	be	that	specific	?
I	mean	,	a	stag	beetle	--	it	's	got	two	points	for	jaws	,	it	's	got	antennae	.	Can	you	be	that	specific	in	the	detail	?	''
And	yeah	,	you	really	can	.
So	how	do	we	do	that	?	Well	,	we	break	it	down	into	a	few	smaller	steps	.
So	let	me	stretch	out	that	equation	.
I	start	with	my	idea	.	I	abstract	it	.
What	's	the	most	abstract	form	?	It	's	a	stick	figure	.
And	from	that	stick	figure	,	I	somehow	have	to	get	to	a	folded	shape	that	has	a	part	for	every	bit	of	the	subject	,	a	flap	for	every	leg	.
And	then	once	I	have	that	folded	shape	that	we	call	the	base	,	you	can	make	the	legs	narrower	,	you	can	bend	them	,	you	can	turn	it	into	the	finished	shape	.
Now	the	first	step	,	pretty	easy	.
Take	an	idea	,	draw	a	stick	figure	.
The	last	step	is	not	so	hard	,	but	that	middle	step	--	going	from	the	abstract	description	to	the	folded	shape	--	that	's	hard	.
But	that	's	the	place	where	the	mathematical	ideas	can	get	us	over	the	hump	.
And	I	'm	going	to	show	you	all	how	to	do	that	so	you	can	go	out	of	here	and	fold	something	.
But	we	're	going	to	start	small	.
This	base	has	a	lot	of	flaps	in	it	.
We	're	going	to	learn	how	to	make	one	flap	.
How	would	you	make	a	single	flap	?
Take	a	square	.	Fold	it	in	half	,	fold	it	in	half	,	fold	it	again	,	until	it	gets	long	and	narrow	,	and	then	we	'll	say	at	the	end	of	that	,	that	's	a	flap	.
I	could	use	that	for	a	leg	,	an	arm	,	anything	like	that	.
What	paper	went	into	that	flap	?
Well	,	if	I	unfold	it	and	go	back	to	the	crease	pattern	,	you	can	see	that	the	upper	left	corner	of	that	shape	is	the	paper	that	went	into	the	flap	.
So	that	's	the	flap	,	and	all	the	rest	of	the	paper	's	left	over	.
I	can	use	it	for	something	else	.
Well	,	there	are	other	ways	of	making	a	flap	.
There	are	other	dimensions	for	flaps	.
If	I	make	the	flaps	skinnier	,	I	can	use	a	bit	less	paper	.
If	I	make	the	flap	as	skinny	as	possible	,	I	get	to	the	limit	of	the	minimum	amount	of	paper	needed	.
And	you	can	see	there	,	it	needs	a	quarter-circle	of	paper	to	make	a	flap	.
There	's	other	ways	of	making	flaps	.
If	I	put	the	flap	on	the	edge	,	it	uses	a	half	circle	of	paper	.
And	if	I	make	the	flap	from	the	middle	,	it	uses	a	full	circle	.
So	,	no	matter	how	I	make	a	flap	,	it	needs	some	part	of	a	circular	region	of	paper	.
So	now	we	're	ready	to	scale	up	.
What	if	I	want	to	make	something	that	has	a	lot	of	flaps	?
What	do	I	need	?	I	need	a	lot	of	circles	.
And	in	the	1990s	,	origami	artists	discovered	these	principles	and	realized	we	could	make	arbitrarily	complicated	figures	just	by	packing	circles	.
And	here	's	where	the	dead	people	start	to	help	us	out	,	because	lots	of	people	have	studied	the	problem	of	packing	circles	.
I	can	rely	on	that	vast	history	of	mathematicians	and	artists	looking	at	disc	packings	and	arrangements	.
And	I	can	use	those	patterns	now	to	create	origami	shapes	.
So	we	figured	out	these	rules	whereby	you	pack	circles	,	you	decorate	the	patterns	of	circles	with	lines	according	to	more	rules	.	That	gives	you	the	folds	.
Those	folds	fold	into	a	base	.	You	shape	the	base	.
You	get	a	folded	shape	--	in	this	case	,	a	cockroach	.
And	it	's	so	simple	.
It	's	so	simple	that	a	computer	could	do	it	.
And	you	say	,	``	Well	,	you	know	,	how	simple	is	that	?	''
But	computers	--	you	need	to	be	able	to	describe	things	in	very	basic	terms	,	and	with	this	,	we	could	.
So	I	wrote	a	computer	program	a	bunch	of	years	ago	called	TreeMaker	,	and	you	can	download	it	from	my	website	.
It	's	free	.	It	runs	on	all	the	major	platforms	--	even	Windows	.
And	you	just	draw	a	stick	figure	,	and	it	calculates	the	crease	pattern	.
It	does	the	circle	packing	,	calculates	the	crease	pattern	,	and	if	you	use	that	stick	figure	that	I	just	showed	--	which	you	can	kind	of	tell	,	it	's	a	deer	,	it	's	got	antlers	--	you	'll	get	this	crease	pattern	.
And	if	you	take	this	crease	pattern	,	you	fold	on	the	dotted	lines	,	you	'll	get	a	base	that	you	can	then	shape	into	a	deer	,	with	exactly	the	crease	pattern	that	you	wanted	.
And	if	you	want	a	different	deer	,	not	a	white-tailed	deer	,	but	you	want	a	mule	deer	,	or	an	elk	,	you	change	the	packing	,	and	you	can	do	an	elk	.
Or	you	could	do	a	moose	.
Or	,	really	,	any	other	kind	of	deer	.
These	techniques	revolutionized	this	art	.
We	found	we	could	do	insects	,	spiders	,	which	are	close	,	things	with	legs	,	things	with	legs	and	wings	,	things	with	legs	and	antennae	.
And	if	folding	a	single	praying	mantis	from	a	single	uncut	square	was	n't	interesting	enough	,	then	you	could	do	two	praying	mantises	from	a	single	uncut	square	.
She	's	eating	him	.
I	call	it	``	Snack	Time	.	''
And	you	can	do	more	than	just	insects	.
This	--	you	can	put	details	,	toes	and	claws	.	A	grizzly	bear	has	claws	.
This	tree	frog	has	toes	.
Actually	,	lots	of	people	in	origami	now	put	toes	into	their	models	.
Toes	have	become	an	origami	meme	,	because	everyone	's	doing	it	.
You	can	make	multiple	subjects	.
So	these	are	a	couple	of	instrumentalists	.
The	guitar	player	from	a	single	square	,	the	bass	player	from	a	single	square	.
And	if	you	say	,	``	Well	,	but	the	guitar	,	bass	--	that	's	not	so	hot	.
Do	a	little	more	complicated	instrument	.	''
Well	,	then	you	could	do	an	organ	.
And	what	this	has	allowed	is	the	creation	of	origami-on-demand	.
So	now	people	can	say	,	``	I	want	exactly	this	and	this	and	this	,	''	and	you	can	go	out	and	fold	it	.
And	sometimes	you	create	high	art	,	and	sometimes	you	pay	the	bills	by	doing	some	commercial	work	.
But	I	want	to	show	you	some	examples	.
Everything	you	'll	see	here	,	except	the	car	,	is	origami	.
Just	to	show	you	,	this	really	was	folded	paper	.
Computers	made	things	move	,	but	these	were	all	real	,	folded	objects	that	we	made	.
And	we	can	use	this	not	just	for	visuals	,	but	it	turns	out	to	be	useful	even	in	the	real	world	.
Surprisingly	,	origami	and	the	structures	that	we	've	developed	in	origami	turn	out	to	have	applications	in	medicine	,	in	science	,	in	space	,	in	the	body	,	consumer	electronics	and	more	.
And	I	want	to	show	you	some	of	these	examples	.
One	of	the	earliest	was	this	pattern	,	this	folded	pattern	,	studied	by	Koryo	Miura	,	a	Japanese	engineer	.
He	studied	a	folding	pattern	,	and	realized	this	could	fold	down	into	an	extremely	compact	package	that	had	a	very	simple	opening	and	closing	structure	.
And	he	used	it	to	design	this	solar	array	.
It	's	an	artist	's	rendition	,	but	it	flew	in	a	Japanese	telescope	in	1995	.
Now	,	there	is	actually	a	little	origami	in	the	James	Webb	Space	Telescope	,	but	it	's	very	simple	.
The	telescope	,	going	up	in	space	,	it	unfolds	in	two	places	.
It	folds	in	thirds	.	It	's	a	very	simple	pattern	--	you	would	n't	even	call	that	origami	.
They	certainly	did	n't	need	to	talk	to	origami	artists	.
But	if	you	want	to	go	higher	and	go	larger	than	this	,	then	you	might	need	some	origami	.
Engineers	at	Lawrence	Livermore	National	Lab	had	an	idea	for	a	telescope	much	larger	.
They	called	it	the	Eyeglass	.
The	design	called	for	geosynchronous	orbit	25,000	miles	up	,	100-meter	diameter	lens	.
So	,	imagine	a	lens	the	size	of	a	football	field	.
There	were	two	groups	of	people	who	were	interested	in	this	:	planetary	scientists	,	who	want	to	look	up	,	and	then	other	people	,	who	wanted	to	look	down	.
Whether	you	look	up	or	look	down	,	how	do	you	get	it	up	in	space	?	You	've	got	to	get	it	up	there	in	a	rocket	.
And	rockets	are	small	.	So	you	have	to	make	it	smaller	.
How	do	you	make	a	large	sheet	of	glass	smaller	?
Well	,	about	the	only	way	is	to	fold	it	up	somehow	.
So	you	have	to	do	something	like	this	.
This	was	a	small	model	.
Folded	lens	,	you	divide	up	the	panels	,	you	add	flexures	.
But	this	pattern	's	not	going	to	work	to	get	something	100	meters	down	to	a	few	meters	.
So	the	Livermore	engineers	,	wanting	to	make	use	of	the	work	of	dead	people	,	or	perhaps	live	origamists	,	said	,	``	Let	's	see	if	someone	else	is	doing	this	sort	of	thing	.	''
So	they	looked	into	the	origami	community	,	we	got	in	touch	with	them	,	and	I	started	working	with	them	.
And	we	developed	a	pattern	together	that	scales	to	arbitrarily	large	size	,	but	that	allows	any	flat	ring	or	disc	to	fold	down	into	a	very	neat	,	compact	cylinder	.
And	they	adopted	that	for	their	first	generation	,	which	was	not	100	meters	--	it	was	a	five-meter	.
But	this	is	a	five-meter	telescope	--	has	about	a	quarter-mile	focal	length	.
And	it	works	perfectly	on	its	test	range	,	and	it	indeed	folds	up	into	a	neat	little	bundle	.
Now	,	there	is	other	origami	in	space	.
Japan	Aerospace	[	Exploration	]	Agency	flew	a	solar	sail	,	and	you	can	see	here	that	the	sail	expands	out	,	and	you	can	still	see	the	fold	lines	.
The	problem	that	's	being	solved	here	is	something	that	needs	to	be	big	and	sheet-like	at	its	destination	,	but	needs	to	be	small	for	the	journey	.
And	that	works	whether	you	're	going	into	space	,	or	whether	you	're	just	going	into	a	body	.
And	this	example	is	the	latter	.
This	is	a	heart	stent	developed	by	Zhong	You	at	Oxford	University	.
It	holds	open	a	blocked	artery	when	it	gets	to	its	destination	,	but	it	needs	to	be	much	smaller	for	the	trip	there	,	through	your	blood	vessels	.
And	this	stent	folds	down	using	an	origami	pattern	,	based	on	a	model	called	the	water	bomb	base	.
Airbag	designers	also	have	the	problem	of	getting	flat	sheets	into	a	small	space	.
And	they	want	to	do	their	design	by	simulation	.
So	they	need	to	figure	out	how	,	in	a	computer	,	to	flatten	an	airbag	.
And	the	algorithms	that	we	developed	to	do	insects	turned	out	to	be	the	solution	for	airbags	to	do	their	simulation	.
And	so	they	can	do	a	simulation	like	this	.
Those	are	the	origami	creases	forming	,	and	now	you	can	see	the	airbag	inflate	and	find	out	,	does	it	work	?
And	that	leads	to	a	really	interesting	idea	.
You	know	,	where	did	these	things	come	from	?
Well	,	the	heart	stent	came	from	that	little	blow-up	box	that	you	might	have	learned	in	elementary	school	.
It	's	the	same	pattern	,	called	the	water	bomb	base	.
The	airbag-flattening	algorithm	came	from	all	the	developments	of	circle	packing	and	the	mathematical	theory	that	was	really	developed	just	to	create	insects	--	things	with	legs	.
The	thing	is	,	that	this	often	happens	in	math	and	science	.
When	you	get	math	involved	,	problems	that	you	solve	for	aesthetic	value	only	,	or	to	create	something	beautiful	,	turn	around	and	turn	out	to	have	an	application	in	the	real	world	.
And	as	weird	and	surprising	as	it	may	sound	,	origami	may	someday	even	save	a	life	.
Thanks	.

Stephen	Palumbi	:	Following	the	mercury	trail
It	can	be	a	very	complicated	thing	,	the	ocean	.
And	it	can	be	a	very	complicated	thing	,	what	human	health	is	.
And	bringing	those	two	together	might	seem	a	very	daunting	task	,	but	what	I	'm	going	to	try	to	say	is	that	even	in	that	complexity	,	there	's	some	simple	themes	that	I	think	,	if	we	understand	,	we	can	really	move	forward	.
And	those	simple	themes	are	n't	really	themes	about	the	complex	science	of	what	's	going	on	,	but	things	that	we	all	pretty	well	know	.
And	I	'm	going	to	start	with	this	one	:	If	momma	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	nobody	happy	.
We	know	that	,	right	?	We	've	experienced	that	.
And	if	we	just	take	that	and	we	build	from	there	,	then	we	can	go	to	the	next	step	,	which	is	that	if	the	ocean	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	nobody	happy	.
That	's	the	theme	of	my	talk	.
And	we	're	making	the	ocean	pretty	unhappy	in	a	lot	of	different	ways	.
This	is	a	shot	of	Cannery	Row	in	1932	.
Cannery	Row	,	at	the	time	,	had	the	biggest	industrial	canning	operation	on	the	west	coast	.
We	piled	enormous	amounts	of	pollution	into	the	air	and	into	the	water	.
Rolf	Bolin	,	who	was	a	professor	at	the	Hopkin	's	Marine	Station	where	I	work	,	wrote	in	the	1940s	that	``	The	fumes	from	the	scum	floating	on	the	inlets	of	the	bay	were	so	bad	they	turned	lead-based	paints	black	.	''
People	working	in	these	canneries	could	barely	stay	there	all	day	because	of	the	smell	,	but	you	know	what	they	came	out	saying	?
They	say	,	``	You	know	what	you	smell	?
You	smell	money	.	''
That	pollution	was	money	to	that	community	,	and	those	people	dealt	with	the	pollution	and	absorbed	it	into	their	skin	and	into	their	bodies	because	they	needed	the	money	.
We	made	the	ocean	unhappy	;	we	made	people	very	unhappy	,	and	we	made	them	unhealthy	.
The	connection	between	ocean	health	and	human	health	is	actually	based	upon	another	couple	simple	adages	,	and	I	want	to	call	that	``	pinch	a	minnow	,	hurt	a	whale	.	''
The	pyramid	of	ocean	life	...
Now	,	when	an	ecologist	looks	at	the	ocean	--	I	have	to	tell	you	--	we	look	at	the	ocean	in	a	very	different	way	,	and	we	see	different	things	than	when	a	regular	person	looks	at	the	ocean	because	when	an	ecologist	looks	at	the	ocean	,	we	see	all	those	interconnections	.
We	see	the	base	of	the	food	chain	,	the	plankton	,	the	small	things	,	and	we	see	how	those	animals	are	food	to	animals	in	the	middle	of	the	pyramid	,	and	on	so	up	this	diagram	.
And	that	flow	,	that	flow	of	life	,	from	the	very	base	up	to	the	very	top	,	is	the	flow	that	ecologists	see	.
And	that	's	what	we	're	trying	to	preserve	when	we	say	,	``	Save	the	ocean	.	Heal	the	ocean	.	''
It	's	that	pyramid	.
Now	why	does	that	matter	for	human	health	?
Because	when	we	jam	things	in	the	bottom	of	that	pyramid	that	should	n't	be	there	,	some	very	frightening	things	happen	.
Pollutants	,	some	pollutants	have	been	created	by	us	:	molecules	like	PCBs	that	ca	n't	be	broken	down	by	our	bodies	.
And	they	go	in	the	base	of	that	pyramid	,	and	they	drift	up	;	they	're	passed	up	that	way	,	on	to	predators	and	on	to	the	top	predators	,	and	in	so	doing	,	they	accumulate	.
Now	,	to	bring	that	home	,	I	thought	I	'd	invent	a	little	game	.
We	do	n't	really	have	to	play	it	;	we	can	just	think	about	it	here	.
It	's	the	Styrofoam	and	chocolate	game	.
Imagine	that	when	we	got	on	this	boat	,	we	were	all	given	two	Styrofoam	peanuts	.
Ca	n't	do	much	with	them	:	Put	them	in	your	pocket	.
Suppose	the	rules	are	:	every	time	you	offer	somebody	a	drink	,	you	give	them	the	drink	,	and	you	give	them	your	Styrofoam	peanuts	too	.
What	'll	happen	is	that	the	Styrofoam	peanuts	will	start	moving	through	our	society	here	,	and	they	will	accumulate	in	the	drunkest	,	stingiest	people	.
There	's	no	mechanism	in	this	game	for	them	to	go	anywhere	but	into	a	bigger	and	bigger	pile	of	indigestible	Styrofoam	peanuts	.
And	that	's	exactly	what	happens	with	PDBs	in	this	food	pyramid	:	They	accumulate	into	the	top	of	it	.
Now	suppose	,	instead	of	Styrofoam	peanuts	,	we	take	these	lovely	little	chocolates	that	we	get	and	we	had	those	instead	.
Well	,	some	of	us	would	be	eating	those	chocolates	instead	of	passing	them	around	,	and	instead	of	accumulating	,	they	will	just	pass	into	our	group	here	and	not	accumulate	in	any	one	group	because	they	're	absorbed	by	us	.
And	that	's	the	difference	between	a	PCB	and	,	say	,	something	natural	like	an	omega-3	,	something	we	want	out	of	the	marine	food	chain	.
PCBs	accumulate	.
We	have	great	examples	of	that	,	unfortunately	.
PCBs	accumulate	in	dolphins	in	Sarasota	Bay	,	in	Texas	,	in	North	Carolina	.
They	get	into	the	food	chain	.
The	dolphins	eat	the	fish	that	have	PCBs	from	the	plankton	,	and	those	PCBs	,	being	fat-soluble	,	accumulate	in	these	dolphins	.
Now	,	a	dolphin	,	mother	dolphin	,	any	dolphin	--	there	's	only	one	way	that	a	PCB	can	get	out	of	a	dolphin	.
And	what	's	that	?
In	mother	's	milk	.
Here	's	a	diagram	of	the	PCB	load	of	dolphins	in	Sarasota	Bay	.
Adult	males	:	a	huge	load	.
Juveniles	:	a	huge	load	.
Females	after	their	first	calf	is	already	weaned	:	a	lower	load	.
Those	females	,	they	're	not	trying	to	.
Those	females	are	passing	the	PCBs	in	the	fat	of	their	own	mother	's	milk	into	their	offspring	,	and	their	offspring	do	n't	survive	.
The	death	rate	in	these	dolphins	,	for	the	first	calf	born	of	every	female	dolphin	,	is	60	to	80	percent	.
These	mothers	pump	their	first	offspring	full	of	this	pollutant	,	and	most	of	them	die	.
Now	,	the	mother	then	can	go	and	reproduce	,	but	what	a	terrible	price	to	pay	for	the	accumulation	of	this	pollutant	in	these	animals	--	the	death	of	the	first-born	calf	.
There	's	another	top	predator	in	the	ocean	,	it	turns	out	.
That	top	predator	,	of	course	,	is	us	.
And	we	also	are	eating	meat	that	comes	from	some	of	these	same	places	.
This	is	whale	meat	that	I	photographed	in	a	grocery	store	in	Tokyo	--	or	is	it	?
In	fact	,	what	we	did	a	few	years	ago	was	learn	how	to	smuggle	a	molecular	biology	lab	into	Tokyo	and	use	it	to	genetically	test	the	DNA	out	of	whale	meat	samples	and	identify	what	they	really	were	.
And	some	of	those	whale	meat	samples	were	whale	meat	.
Some	of	them	were	illegal	whale	meat	,	by	the	way	.
That	's	another	story	.
But	some	of	them	were	not	whale	meat	at	all	.
Even	though	they	were	labeled	whale	meat	,	they	were	dolphin	meat	.
Some	of	them	were	dolphin	liver	.	Some	of	them	were	dolphin	blubber	.
And	those	dolphin	parts	had	a	huge	load	of	PCBs	,	dioxins	and	heavy	metals	.
And	that	huge	load	was	passing	into	the	people	that	ate	this	meat	.
It	turns	out	that	a	lot	of	dolphins	are	being	sold	as	meat	in	the	whale	meat	market	around	the	world	.
That	's	a	tragedy	for	those	populations	,	but	it	's	also	a	tragedy	for	the	people	eating	them	because	they	do	n't	know	that	that	's	toxic	meat	.
We	had	these	data	a	few	years	ago	.
I	remember	sitting	at	my	desk	being	about	the	only	person	in	the	world	who	knew	that	whale	meat	being	sold	in	these	markets	was	really	dolphin	meat	,	and	it	was	toxic	.
It	had	two-to-three-to-400	times	the	toxic	loads	ever	allowed	by	the	EPA	.
And	I	remember	there	sitting	at	my	desk	thinking	,	``	Well	,	I	know	this	.	This	is	a	great	scientific	discovery	,	''	but	it	was	so	awful	.
And	for	the	very	first	time	in	my	scientific	career	,	I	broke	scientific	protocol	,	which	is	that	you	take	the	data	and	publish	them	in	scientific	journals	and	then	begin	to	talk	about	them	.
We	sent	a	very	polite	letter	to	the	Minister	of	Health	in	Japan	and	simply	pointed	out	that	this	is	an	intolerable	situation	,	not	for	us	,	but	for	the	people	of	Japan	because	mothers	who	may	be	breastfeeding	,	who	may	have	young	children	,	would	be	buying	something	that	they	thought	was	healthy	,	but	it	was	really	toxic	.
That	led	to	a	whole	series	of	other	campaigns	in	Japan	,	and	I	'm	really	proud	to	say	that	at	this	point	,	it	's	very	difficult	to	buy	anything	in	Japan	that	's	labeled	incorrectly	,	even	though	they	're	still	selling	whale	meat	,	which	I	believe	they	should	n't	.
But	at	least	it	's	labeled	correctly	,	and	you	're	no	longer	going	to	be	buying	toxic	dolphin	meat	instead	.
It	is	n't	just	there	that	this	happens	,	but	in	a	natural	diet	of	some	communities	in	the	Canadian	arctic	and	in	the	United	States	and	in	the	European	arctic	,	a	natural	diet	of	seals	and	whales	leads	to	an	accumulation	of	PCBs	that	have	gathered	up	from	all	parts	of	the	world	and	ended	up	in	these	women	.
These	women	have	toxic	breast	milk	.
They	can	not	feed	their	offspring	,	their	children	,	their	breast	milk	because	of	the	accumulation	of	these	toxins	in	their	food	chain	,	in	their	part	of	the	world	's	ocean	pyramid	.
That	means	their	immune	systems	are	compromised	.
It	means	that	their	children	's	development	can	be	compromised	.
And	the	world	's	attention	on	this	over	the	last	decade	has	reduced	the	problem	for	these	women	,	not	by	changing	the	pyramid	,	but	by	changing	what	they	particularly	eat	out	of	it	.
We	've	taken	them	out	of	their	natural	pyramid	in	order	to	solve	this	problem	.
That	's	a	good	thing	for	this	particular	acute	problem	,	but	it	does	nothing	to	solve	the	pyramid	problem	.
There	's	other	ways	of	breaking	the	pyramid	.
The	pyramid	,	if	we	jam	things	in	the	bottom	,	can	get	backed	up	like	a	sewer	line	that	's	clogged	.
And	if	we	jam	nutrients	,	sewage	,	fertilizer	in	the	base	of	that	food	pyramid	,	it	can	back	up	all	through	it	.
We	end	up	with	things	we	've	heard	about	before	:	red	tides	,	for	example	,	which	are	blooms	of	toxic	algae	floating	through	the	oceans	causing	neurological	damage	.
We	can	also	see	blooms	of	bacteria	,	blooms	of	viruses	in	the	ocean	.
These	are	two	shots	of	a	red	tide	coming	on	shore	here	and	a	bacteria	in	the	genus	vibrio	,	which	includes	the	genus	that	has	cholera	in	it	.
How	many	people	have	seen	a	``	beach	closed	''	sign	?
Why	does	that	happen	?
It	happens	because	we	have	jammed	so	much	into	the	base	of	the	natural	ocean	pyramid	that	these	bacteria	clog	it	up	and	overfill	onto	our	beaches	.
Often	what	jams	us	up	is	sewage	.
Now	how	many	of	you	have	ever	gone	to	a	state	park	or	a	national	park	where	you	had	a	big	sign	at	the	front	saying	,	``	Closed	because	human	sewage	is	so	far	over	this	park	that	you	ca	n't	use	it	''	?
Not	very	often	.	We	would	n't	tolerate	that	.
We	would	n't	tolerate	our	parks	being	swamped	by	human	sewage	,	but	beaches	are	closed	a	lot	in	our	country	.
They	're	closed	more	and	more	and	more	all	around	the	world	for	the	same	reason	,	and	I	believe	we	should	n't	tolerate	that	either	.
It	's	not	just	a	question	of	cleanliness	;	it	's	also	a	question	of	how	those	organisms	then	turn	into	human	disease	.
These	vibrios	,	these	bacteria	,	can	actually	infect	people	.
They	can	go	into	your	skin	and	create	skin	infections	.
This	is	a	graph	from	NOAA	's	ocean	and	human	health	initiative	,	showing	the	rise	of	the	infections	by	vibrio	in	people	over	the	last	few	years	.
Surfers	,	for	example	,	know	this	incredibly	.
And	if	you	can	see	on	some	surfing	sites	,	in	fact	,	not	only	do	you	see	what	the	waves	are	like	or	what	the	weather	's	like	,	but	on	some	surf	rider	sites	,	you	see	a	little	flashing	poo	alert	.
That	means	that	the	beach	might	have	great	waves	,	but	it	's	a	dangerous	place	for	surfers	to	be	because	they	can	carry	with	them	,	even	after	a	great	day	of	surfing	,	this	legacy	of	an	infection	that	might	take	a	very	long	time	to	solve	.
Some	of	these	infections	are	actually	carrying	antibiotic	resistance	genes	now	,	and	that	makes	them	even	more	difficult	.
These	same	infections	create	harmful	algal	blooms	.
Those	blooms	are	generating	other	kinds	of	chemicals	.
This	is	just	a	simple	list	of	some	of	the	types	of	poisons	that	come	out	of	these	harmful	algal	blooms	:	shellfish	poisoning	,	fish	ciguatera	,	diarrheic	shellfish	poisoning	--	you	do	n't	want	to	know	about	that	--	neurotoxic	shellfish	poisoning	,	paralytic	shellfish	poisoning	.
These	are	things	that	are	getting	into	our	food	chain	because	of	these	blooms	.
Rita	Calwell	very	famously	traced	a	very	interesting	story	of	cholera	into	human	communities	,	brought	there	,	not	by	a	normal	human	vector	,	but	by	a	marine	vector	,	this	copepod	.
Copepods	are	small	crustaceans	.
They	're	a	tiny	fraction	of	an	inch	long	,	and	they	can	carry	on	their	little	legs	some	of	the	cholera	bacteria	that	then	leads	to	human	disease	.
That	has	sparked	cholera	epidemics	in	ports	along	the	world	and	has	led	to	increased	concentration	on	trying	to	make	sure	shipping	does	n't	move	these	vectors	of	cholera	around	the	world	.
So	what	do	you	do	?
We	have	major	problems	in	disrupted	ecosystem	flow	that	the	pyramid	may	not	be	working	so	well	,	that	the	flow	from	the	base	up	into	it	is	being	blocked	and	clogged	.
What	do	you	do	when	you	have	this	sort	of	disrupted	flow	?
Well	,	there	's	a	bunch	of	things	you	could	do	.
You	could	call	Joe	the	Plumber	,	for	example	.
And	he	could	come	in	and	fix	the	flow	.
But	in	fact	,	if	you	look	around	the	world	,	not	only	are	there	hope	spots	for	where	we	may	be	able	to	fix	problems	,	there	have	been	places	where	problems	have	been	fixed	,	where	people	have	come	to	grips	with	these	issues	and	begun	to	turn	them	around	.
Monterey	is	one	of	those	.
I	started	out	showing	how	much	we	had	distressed	the	Monterey	Bay	ecosystem	with	pollution	and	the	canning	industry	and	all	of	the	attendant	problems	.
In	1932	,	that	's	the	picture	.
In	2009	,	the	picture	is	dramatically	different	.
The	canneries	are	gone	.	The	pollution	has	abated	.
But	there	's	a	greater	sense	here	that	what	the	individual	communities	need	is	working	ecosystems	.
They	need	a	functioning	pyramid	from	the	base	all	the	way	to	the	top	.
And	that	pyramid	in	Monterey	,	right	now	,	because	of	the	efforts	of	a	lot	of	different	people	,	is	functioning	better	than	it	's	ever	functioned	for	the	last	150	years	.
It	did	n't	happen	accidentally	.
It	happened	because	many	people	put	their	time	and	effort	and	their	pioneering	spirit	into	this	.
On	the	left	there	,	Julia	Platt	,	the	mayor	of	my	little	hometown	in	Pacific	Grove	.
At	74	years	old	,	became	mayor	because	something	had	to	be	done	to	protect	the	ocean	.
In	1931	,	she	produced	California	's	first	community-based	marine	protected	area	,	right	next	to	the	biggest	polluting	cannery	,	because	Julia	knew	that	when	the	canneries	eventually	were	gone	,	the	ocean	needed	a	place	to	grow	from	,	that	the	ocean	needed	a	place	to	spark	a	seed	,	and	she	wanted	to	provide	that	seed	.
Other	people	,	like	David	Packard	and	Julie	Packard	,	who	were	instrumental	in	producing	the	Monterey	Bay	aquarium	to	lock	into	people	's	notion	that	the	ocean	and	the	health	of	the	ocean	ecosystem	were	just	as	important	to	the	economy	of	this	area	as	eating	the	ecosystem	would	be	.
That	change	in	thinking	has	led	to	a	dramatic	shift	,	not	only	in	the	fortunes	of	Monterey	Bay	,	but	other	places	around	the	world	.
Well	,	I	want	to	leave	you	with	the	thought	that	what	we	're	really	trying	to	do	here	is	protect	this	ocean	pyramid	,	and	that	ocean	pyramid	connects	to	our	own	pyramid	of	life	.
It	's	an	ocean	planet	,	and	we	think	of	ourselves	as	a	terrestrial	species	,	but	the	pyramid	of	life	in	the	ocean	and	our	own	lives	on	land	are	intricately	connected	.
And	it	's	only	through	having	the	ocean	being	healthy	that	we	can	remain	healthy	ourselves	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

In	today	's	world	,	balancing	school	,	work	,	kids	and	more	,	most	of	us	can	only	hope	for	the	recommended	eight	hours	of	sleep	.	Examining	the	science	behind	our	body	's	internal	clock	,	Jessa	Gamble	reveals	the	surprising	and	substantial	program	of	rest	we	should	be	observing	.
evolution	,	humanity	,	personal	growth	,	science	,	self
957
Jessa	Gamble	:	Our	natural	sleep	cycle
Let	's	start	with	day	and	night	.
Life	evolved	under	conditions	of	light	and	darkness	,	light	and	then	darkness	.
And	so	plants	and	animals	developed	their	own	internal	clocks	so	that	they	would	be	ready	for	these	changes	in	light	.
These	are	chemical	clocks	,	and	they	're	found	in	every	known	being	that	has	two	or	more	cells	and	in	some	that	only	have	one	cell	.
I	'll	give	you	an	example	--	if	you	take	a	horseshoe	crab	off	the	beach	,	and	you	fly	it	all	the	way	across	the	continent	,	and	you	drop	it	into	a	sloped	cage	,	it	will	scramble	up	the	floor	of	the	cage	as	the	tide	is	rising	on	its	home	shores	,	and	it	'll	skitter	down	again	right	as	the	water	is	receding	thousands	of	miles	away	.
It	'll	do	this	for	weeks	,	until	it	kind	of	gradually	loses	the	plot	.
And	it	's	incredible	to	watch	,	but	there	's	nothing	psychic	or	paranormal	going	on	;	it	's	simply	that	these	crabs	have	internal	cycles	that	correspond	,	usually	,	with	what	's	going	on	around	it	.
So	,	we	have	this	ability	as	well	.
And	in	humans	,	we	call	it	the	``	body	clock	.	''
You	can	see	this	most	clearly	when	you	take	away	someone	's	watch	and	you	shut	them	into	a	bunker	,	deep	underground	,	for	a	couple	of	months	.
People	actually	volunteer	for	this	,	and	they	usually	come	out	kind	of	raving	about	their	productive	time	in	the	hole	.
So	,	no	matter	how	atypical	these	subjects	would	have	to	be	,	they	all	show	the	same	thing	.
They	get	up	just	a	little	bit	later	every	day	--	say	15	minutes	or	so	--	and	they	kind	of	drift	all	the	way	around	the	clock	like	this	over	the	course	of	the	weeks	.
And	so	,	in	this	way	we	know	that	they	are	working	on	their	own	internal	clocks	,	rather	than	somehow	sensing	the	day	outside	.
So	fine	,	we	have	a	body	clock	,	and	it	turns	out	that	it	's	incredibly	important	in	our	lives	.
It	's	a	huge	driver	for	culture	and	I	think	that	it	's	the	most	underrated	force	on	our	behavior	.
We	evolved	as	a	species	near	the	equator	,	and	so	we	're	very	well-equipped	to	deal	with	12	hours	of	daylight	and	12	hours	of	darkness	.
But	of	course	,	we	've	spread	to	every	corner	of	the	globe	and	in	Arctic	Canada	,	where	I	live	,	we	have	perpetual	daylight	in	summer	and	24	hours	of	darkness	in	winter	.
So	the	culture	,	the	northern	aboriginal	culture	,	traditionally	has	been	highly	seasonal	.
In	winter	,	there	's	a	lot	of	sleeping	going	on	;	you	enjoy	your	family	life	inside	.
And	in	summer	,	it	's	almost	manic	hunting	and	working	activity	very	long	hours	,	very	active	.
So	,	what	would	our	natural	rhythm	look	like	?
What	would	our	sleeping	patterns	be	in	the	sort	of	ideal	sense	?
Well	,	it	turns	out	that	when	people	are	living	without	any	sort	of	artificial	light	at	all	,	they	sleep	twice	every	night	.
They	go	to	bed	around	8:00	p.m	.
until	midnight	and	then	again	,	they	sleep	from	about	2:00	a.m.	until	sunrise	.
And	in-between	,	they	have	a	couple	of	hours	of	sort	of	meditative	quiet	in	bed	.
And	during	this	time	,	there	's	a	surge	of	prolactin	,	the	likes	of	which	a	modern	day	never	sees	.
The	people	in	these	studies	report	feeling	so	awake	during	the	daytime	,	that	they	realize	they	're	experiencing	true	wakefulness	for	the	first	time	in	their	lives	.
So	,	cut	to	the	modern	day	.
We	're	living	in	a	culture	of	jet	lag	,	global	travel	,	24-hour	business	,	shift	work	.
And	you	know	,	our	modern	ways	of	doing	things	have	their	advantages	,	but	I	believe	we	should	understand	the	costs	.
Thank	you	.

Mihaly	Csikszentmihalyi	on	flow
I	grew	up	in	Europe	,	and	World	War	II	caught	me	when	I	was	between	seven	and	10	years	old	.
And	I	realized	how	few	of	the	grown-ups	that	I	knew	were	able	to	withstand	the	tragedies	that	the	war	visited	on	them	--	how	few	of	them	could	even	resemble	a	normal	,	contented	,	satisfied	,	happy	life	once	their	job	,	their	home	,	their	security	was	destroyed	by	the	war	.
So	I	became	interested	in	understanding	what	contributed	to	a	life	that	was	worth	living	.
And	I	tried	,	as	a	child	,	as	a	teenager	,	to	read	philosophy	and	to	get	involved	in	art	and	religion	and	many	other	ways	that	I	could	see	as	a	possible	answer	to	that	question	.
And	finally	I	ended	up	encountering	psychology	by	chance	.
I	was	at	a	ski	resort	in	Switzerland	without	any	money	to	actually	enjoy	myself	,	because	the	snow	had	melted	and	I	did	n't	have	money	to	go	to	a	movie	.	But	I	found	that	on	the	--	I	read	in	the	newspapers	that	there	was	to	be	a	presentation	by	someone	in	a	place	that	I	'd	seen	in	the	center	of	Zurich	,	and	it	was	about	flying	saucers	[	that	]	he	was	going	to	talk	.
And	I	thought	,	well	,	since	I	ca	n't	go	to	the	movies	,	at	least	I	will	go	for	free	to	listen	to	flying	saucers	.
And	the	man	who	talked	at	that	evening	lecture	was	very	interesting	.
Instead	of	talking	about	little	green	men	,	he	talked	about	how	the	psyche	of	the	Europeans	had	been	traumatized	by	the	war	,	and	now	they	're	projecting	flying	saucers	into	the	sky	.
He	talked	about	how	the	mandalas	of	ancient	Hindu	religion	were	kind	of	projected	into	the	sky	as	an	attempt	to	regain	some	sense	of	order	after	the	chaos	of	war	.
And	this	seemed	very	interesting	to	me	.
And	I	started	reading	his	books	after	that	lecture	.
And	that	was	Carl	Jung	,	whose	name	or	work	I	had	no	idea	about	.
Then	I	came	to	this	country	to	study	psychology	and	I	started	trying	to	understand	the	roots	of	happiness	.
This	is	a	typical	result	that	many	people	have	presented	,	and	there	are	many	variations	on	it	.
But	this	,	for	instance	,	shows	that	about	30	percent	of	the	people	surveyed	in	the	United	States	since	1956	say	that	their	life	is	very	happy	.
And	that	has	n't	changed	at	all	.
Whereas	the	personal	income	,	on	a	scale	that	has	been	held	constant	to	accommodate	for	inflation	,	has	more	than	doubled	,	almost	tripled	,	in	that	period	.
But	you	find	essentially	the	same	results	,	namely	,	that	after	a	certain	basic	point	--	which	corresponds	more	or	less	to	just	a	few	1,000	dollars	above	the	minimum	poverty	level	--	increases	in	material	well-being	do	n't	seem	to	affect	how	happy	people	are	.
In	fact	,	you	can	find	that	the	lack	of	basic	resources	,	material	resources	,	contributes	to	unhappiness	,	but	the	increase	in	material	resources	does	not	increase	happiness	.
So	my	research	has	been	focused	more	on	--	after	finding	out	these	things	that	actually	corresponded	to	my	own	experience	,	I	tried	to	understand	:	where	--	in	everyday	life	,	in	our	normal	experience	--	do	we	feel	really	happy	?
And	to	start	those	studies	about	40	years	ago	,	I	began	to	look	at	creative	people	--	first	artists	and	scientists	,	and	so	forth	--	trying	to	understand	what	made	them	feel	that	it	was	worth	essentially	spending	their	life	doing	things	for	which	many	of	them	did	n't	expect	either	fame	or	fortune	,	but	which	made	their	life	meaningful	and	worth	doing	.
This	was	one	of	the	leading	composers	of	American	music	back	in	the	'70s	.
And	the	interview	was	40	pages	long	.
But	this	little	excerpt	is	a	very	good	summary	of	what	he	was	saying	during	the	interview	.
And	it	describes	how	he	feels	when	composing	is	going	well	.
And	he	says	by	describing	it	as	an	ecstatic	state	.
Now	,	``	ecstasy	''	in	Greek	meant	simply	to	stand	to	the	side	of	something	.
And	then	it	became	essentially	an	analogy	for	a	mental	state	where	you	feel	that	you	are	not	doing	your	ordinary	everyday	routines	.
So	ecstasy	is	essentially	a	stepping	into	an	alternative	reality	.
And	it	's	interesting	,	if	you	think	about	it	,	how	,	when	we	think	about	the	civilizations	that	we	look	up	to	as	having	been	pinnacles	of	human	achievement	--	whether	it	's	China	,	Greece	,	the	Hindu	civilization	,	or	the	Mayas	,	or	Egyptians	--	what	we	know	about	them	is	really	about	their	ecstasies	,	not	about	their	everyday	life	.
We	know	the	temples	they	built	,	where	people	could	come	to	experience	a	different	reality	.
We	know	about	the	circuses	,	the	arenas	,	the	theaters	.
These	are	the	remains	of	civilizations	and	they	are	the	places	that	people	went	to	experience	life	in	a	more	concentrated	,	more	ordered	form	.
Now	,	this	man	does	n't	need	to	go	to	a	place	like	this	,	which	is	also	--	this	place	,	this	arena	,	which	is	built	like	a	Greek	amphitheatre	,	is	a	place	for	ecstasy	also	.
We	are	participating	in	a	reality	that	is	different	from	that	of	the	everyday	life	that	we	're	used	to	.
But	this	man	does	n't	need	to	go	there	.
He	needs	just	a	piece	of	paper	where	he	can	put	down	little	marks	,	and	as	he	does	that	,	he	can	imagine	sounds	that	had	not	existed	before	in	that	particular	combination	.
So	once	he	gets	to	that	point	of	beginning	to	create	,	like	Jennifer	did	in	her	improvisation	,	a	new	reality	--	that	is	,	a	moment	of	ecstasy	--	he	enters	that	different	reality	.
Now	he	says	also	that	this	is	so	intense	an	experience	that	it	feels	almost	as	if	he	did	n't	exist	.
And	that	sounds	like	a	kind	of	a	romantic	exaggeration	.
But	actually	,	our	nervous	system	is	incapable	of	processing	more	than	about	110	bits	of	information	per	second	.
And	in	order	to	hear	me	and	understand	what	I	'm	saying	,	you	need	to	process	about	60	bits	per	second	.
That	's	why	you	ca	n't	hear	more	than	two	people	.
You	ca	n't	understand	more	than	two	people	talking	to	you	.
Well	,	when	you	are	really	involved	in	this	completely	engaging	process	of	creating	something	new	,	as	this	man	is	,	he	does	n't	have	enough	attention	left	over	to	monitor	how	his	body	feels	,	or	his	problems	at	home	.
He	ca	n't	feel	even	that	he	's	hungry	or	tired	.
His	body	disappears	,	his	identity	disappears	from	his	consciousness	,	because	he	does	n't	have	enough	attention	,	like	none	of	us	do	,	to	really	do	well	something	that	requires	a	lot	of	concentration	,	and	at	the	same	time	to	feel	that	he	exists	.
So	existence	is	temporarily	suspended	.
And	he	says	that	his	hand	seems	to	be	moving	by	itself	.
Now	,	I	could	look	at	my	hand	for	two	weeks	,	and	I	would	n't	feel	any	awe	or	wonder	,	because	I	ca	n't	compose	.
So	what	it	's	telling	you	here	is	that	obviously	this	automatic	,	spontaneous	process	that	he	's	describing	can	only	happen	to	someone	who	is	very	well	trained	and	who	has	developed	technique	.
And	it	has	become	a	kind	of	a	truism	in	the	study	of	creativity	that	you	ca	n't	be	creating	anything	with	less	than	10	years	of	technical-knowledge	immersion	in	a	particular	field	.
Whether	it	's	mathematics	or	music	,	it	takes	that	long	to	be	able	to	begin	to	change	something	in	a	way	that	it	's	better	than	what	was	there	before	.
Now	,	when	that	happens	,	he	says	the	music	just	flows	out	.
And	because	all	of	these	people	I	started	interviewing	--	this	was	an	interview	which	is	over	30	years	old	--	so	many	of	the	people	described	this	as	a	spontaneous	flow	that	I	called	this	type	of	experience	the	``	flow	experience	.	''
And	it	happens	in	different	realms	.
For	instance	,	a	poet	describes	it	in	this	form	.
This	is	by	a	student	of	mine	who	interviewed	some	of	the	leading	writers	and	poets	in	the	United	States	.
And	it	describes	the	same	effortless	,	spontaneous	feeling	that	you	get	when	you	enter	into	this	ecstatic	state	.
This	poet	describes	it	as	opening	a	door	that	floats	in	the	sky	--	a	very	similar	description	to	what	Albert	Einstein	gave	as	to	how	he	imagined	the	forces	of	relativity	,	when	he	was	struggling	with	trying	to	understand	how	it	worked	.
But	it	happens	in	other	activities	.
For	instance	,	this	is	another	student	of	mine	,	Susan	Jackson	from	Australia	,	who	did	work	with	some	of	the	leading	athletes	in	the	world	.
And	you	see	here	in	this	description	of	an	Olympic	skater	,	the	same	essential	description	of	the	phenomenology	of	the	inner	state	of	the	person	.
You	do	n't	think	;	it	goes	automatically	,	if	you	merge	yourself	with	the	music	,	and	so	forth	.
It	happens	also	,	actually	,	in	the	most	recent	book	I	wrote	,	called	``	Good	Business	,	''	where	I	interviewed	some	of	the	CEOs	who	had	been	nominated	by	their	peers	as	being	both	very	successful	and	very	ethical	,	very	socially	responsible	.
You	see	that	these	people	define	success	as	something	that	helps	others	and	at	the	same	time	makes	you	feel	happy	as	you	are	working	at	it	.
And	like	all	of	these	successful	and	responsible	CEOs	say	,	you	ca	n't	have	just	one	of	these	things	be	successful	if	you	want	a	meaningful	and	successful	job	.
Anita	Roddick	is	another	one	of	these	CEOs	we	interviewed	.
She	is	the	founder	of	Body	Shop	,	the	natural	cosmetics	king	.
It	's	kind	of	a	passion	that	comes	from	doing	the	best	and	having	flow	while	you	're	working	.
This	is	an	interesting	little	quote	from	Masaru	Ibuka	,	who	was	at	that	time	starting	out	Sony	without	any	money	,	without	a	product	--	they	did	n't	have	a	product	,	they	did	n't	have	anything	,	but	they	had	an	idea	.
And	the	idea	he	had	was	to	establish	a	place	of	work	where	engineers	can	feel	the	joy	of	technological	innovation	,	be	aware	of	their	mission	to	society	and	work	to	their	heart	's	content	.
I	could	n't	improve	on	this	as	a	good	example	of	how	flow	enters	the	workplace	.
Now	,	when	we	do	studies	--	we	have	,	with	other	colleagues	around	the	world	,	done	over	8,000	interviews	of	people	--	from	Dominican	monks	,	to	blind	nuns	,	to	Himalayan	climbers	,	to	Navajo	shepherds	--	who	enjoy	their	work	.
And	regardless	of	the	culture	,	regardless	of	education	or	whatever	,	there	are	these	seven	conditions	that	seem	to	be	there	when	a	person	is	in	flow	.
There	's	this	focus	that	,	once	it	becomes	intense	,	leads	to	a	sense	of	ecstasy	,	a	sense	of	clarity	:	you	know	exactly	what	you	want	to	do	from	one	moment	to	the	other	;	you	get	immediate	feedback	.
You	know	that	what	you	need	to	do	is	possible	to	do	,	even	though	difficult	,	and	sense	of	time	disappears	,	you	forget	yourself	,	you	feel	part	of	something	larger	.
And	once	the	conditions	are	present	,	what	you	are	doing	becomes	worth	doing	for	its	own	sake	.
In	our	studies	,	we	represent	the	everyday	life	of	people	in	this	simple	scheme	.
And	we	can	measure	this	very	precisely	,	actually	,	because	we	give	people	electronic	pagers	that	go	off	10	times	a	day	,	and	whenever	they	go	off	you	say	what	you	're	doing	,	how	you	feel	,	where	you	are	,	what	you	're	thinking	about	.
And	two	things	that	we	measure	is	the	amount	of	challenge	people	experience	at	that	moment	and	the	amount	of	skill	that	they	feel	they	have	at	that	moment	.
So	for	each	person	we	can	establish	an	average	,	which	is	the	center	of	the	diagram	.
That	would	be	your	mean	level	of	challenge	and	skill	,	which	will	be	different	from	that	of	anybody	else	.
But	you	have	a	kind	of	a	set	point	there	,	which	would	be	in	the	middle	.
If	we	know	what	that	set	point	is	,	we	can	predict	fairly	accurately	when	you	will	be	in	flow	,	and	it	will	be	when	your	challenges	are	higher	than	average	and	skills	are	higher	than	average	.
And	you	may	be	doing	things	very	differently	from	other	people	,	but	for	everyone	that	flow	channel	,	that	area	there	,	will	be	when	you	are	doing	what	you	really	like	to	do	--	play	the	piano	,	be	with	your	best	friend	,	perhaps	work	,	if	work	is	what	provides	flow	for	you	.
And	then	the	other	areas	become	less	and	less	positive	.
Arousal	is	still	good	because	you	are	over-challenged	there	.
Your	skills	are	not	quite	as	high	as	they	should	be	,	but	you	can	move	into	flow	fairly	easily	by	just	developing	a	little	more	skill	.
So	,	arousal	is	the	area	where	most	people	learn	from	,	because	that	's	where	they	're	pushed	beyond	their	comfort	zone	and	to	enter	that	--	going	back	to	flow	--	then	they	develop	higher	skills	.
Control	is	also	a	good	place	to	be	,	because	there	you	feel	comfortable	,	but	not	very	excited	.
It	's	not	very	challenging	any	more	.
And	if	you	want	to	enter	flow	from	control	,	you	have	to	increase	the	challenges	.
So	those	two	are	ideal	and	complementary	areas	from	which	flow	is	easy	to	go	into	.
The	other	combinations	of	challenge	and	skill	become	progressively	less	optimal	.
Relaxation	is	fine	--	you	still	feel	OK	.
Boredom	begins	to	be	very	aversive	and	apathy	becomes	very	negative	:	you	do	n't	feel	that	you	're	doing	anything	,	you	do	n't	use	your	skills	,	there	's	no	challenge	.
Unfortunately	,	a	lot	of	people	's	experience	is	in	apathy	.
The	largest	single	contributor	to	that	experience	is	watching	television	;	the	next	one	is	being	in	the	bathroom	,	sitting	.
Even	though	sometimes	watching	television	about	seven	to	eight	percent	of	the	time	is	in	flow	,	but	that	's	when	you	choose	a	program	you	really	want	to	watch	and	you	get	feedback	from	it	.
So	the	question	we	are	trying	to	address	--	and	I	'm	way	over	time	--	is	how	to	put	more	and	more	of	everyday	life	in	that	flow	channel	.
And	that	is	the	kind	of	challenge	that	we	're	trying	to	understand	.
And	some	of	you	obviously	know	how	to	do	that	spontaneously	without	any	advice	,	but	unfortunately	a	lot	of	people	do	n't	.
And	that	's	what	our	mandate	is	,	in	a	way	,	to	do	.
Thank	you	.

Yves	Behar	's	supercharged	motorcycle	design
Forrest	North	:	The	beginning	of	any	collaboration	starts	with	a	conversation	.
And	I	would	like	to	share	with	you	some	of	the	bits	of	the	conversation	that	we	started	with	.
I	grew	up	in	a	log	cabin	in	Washington	state	with	too	much	time	on	my	hands	.
Yves	Behar	:	And	in	scenic	Switzerland	for	me	.
FN	:	I	always	had	a	passion	for	alternative	vehicles	.
This	is	a	land	yacht	racing	across	the	desert	in	Nevada	.
YB	:	Combination	of	windsurfing	and	skiing	into	this	invention	there	.
FN	:	And	I	also	had	an	interest	in	dangerous	inventions	.
This	is	a	100,000-volt	Tesla	coil	that	I	built	in	my	bedroom	,	much	to	the	dismay	of	my	mother	.
YB	:	To	the	dismay	of	my	mother	,	this	is	dangerous	teenage	fashion	right	there	.
FN	:	And	I	brought	this	all	together	,	this	passion	with	alternative	energy	and	raced	a	solar	car	across	Australia	--	also	the	U.S.	and	Japan	.
YB	:	So	,	wind	power	,	solar	power	--	we	had	a	lot	to	talk	about	.
We	had	a	lot	that	got	us	excited	.
So	we	decided	to	do	a	special	project	together	.
To	combine	engineering	and	design	and	...
FN	:	Really	make	a	fully	integrated	product	,	something	beautiful	.
YB	:	And	we	made	a	baby	.
FN	:	Can	you	bring	out	our	baby	?
This	baby	is	fully	electric	.
It	goes	150	miles	an	hour	.
It	's	twice	the	range	of	any	electric	motorcycle	.
Really	the	exciting	thing	about	a	motorcycle	is	just	the	beautiful	integration	of	engineering	and	design	.
It	's	got	an	amazing	user	experience	.
It	was	wonderful	working	with	Yves	Behar	.
He	came	up	with	our	name	and	logo	.	We	're	Mission	Motors	.
And	we	've	only	got	three	minutes	,	but	we	could	talk	about	it	for	hours	.
YB	:	Thank	you	.
FN	:	Thank	you	TED	.	And	thank	you	Chris	,	for	having	us	.

In	this	uplifting	talk	,	Katherine	Fulton	sketches	the	new	future	of	philanthropy	--	one	where	collaboration	and	innovation	allow	regular	people	to	do	big	things	,	even	when	money	is	scarce	.	Giving	five	practical	examples	of	crowd-driven	philanthropy	,	she	calls	for	a	new	generation	of	citizen	leaders	.

Katherine	Fulton	:	You	are	the	future	of	philanthropy
I	want	to	help	you	re-perceive	what	philanthropy	is	,	what	it	could	be	,	and	what	your	relationship	to	it	is	.
And	in	doing	that	,	I	want	to	offer	you	a	vision	,	an	imagined	future	,	if	you	will	,	of	how	,	as	the	poet	Seamus	Heaney	has	put	it	,	``	Once	in	a	lifetime	the	longed-for	tidal	wave	of	justice	can	rise	up	,	and	hope	and	history	rhyme	.	''
I	want	to	start	with	these	word	pairs	here	.
We	all	know	which	side	of	these	we	'd	like	to	be	on	.
When	philanthropy	was	reinvented	a	century	ago	,	when	the	foundation	form	was	actually	invented	,	they	did	n't	think	of	themselves	on	the	wrong	side	of	these	either	.
In	fact	they	would	never	have	thought	of	themselves	as	closed	and	set	in	their	ways	,	as	slow	to	respond	to	new	challenges	,	as	small	and	risk-averse	.
And	in	fact	they	were	n't	.	They	were	reinventing	charity	in	those	times	,	what	Rockefeller	called	``	the	business	of	benevolence	.	''
But	by	the	end	of	the	20th	century	,	a	new	generation	of	critics	and	reformers	had	come	to	see	philanthropy	just	this	way	.
The	thing	to	watch	for	as	a	global	philanthropy	industry	comes	about	--	and	that	's	exactly	what	is	happening	--	is	how	the	aspiration	is	to	flip	these	old	assumptions	,	for	philanthropy	to	become	open	and	big	and	fast	and	connected	,	in	service	of	the	long	term	.
This	entrepreneurial	energy	is	emerging	from	many	quarters	.
And	it	's	driven	and	propelled	forward	by	new	leaders	,	like	many	of	the	people	here	,	by	new	tools	,	like	the	ones	we	've	seen	here	,	and	by	new	pressures	.
I	've	been	following	this	change	for	quite	a	while	now	,	and	participating	in	it	.
This	report	is	our	main	public	report	.
What	it	tells	is	the	story	of	how	today	actually	could	be	as	historic	as	100	years	ago	.
What	I	want	to	do	is	share	some	of	the	coolest	things	that	are	going	on	with	you	.
And	as	I	do	that	,	I	'm	not	going	to	dwell	much	on	the	very	large	philanthropy	that	everybody	already	knows	about	--	the	Gates	or	the	Soros	or	the	Google	.
Instead	,	what	I	want	to	do	is	talk	about	the	philanthropy	of	all	of	us	:	the	democratization	of	philanthropy	.
This	is	a	moment	in	history	when	the	average	person	has	more	power	than	at	any	time	.
What	I	'm	going	to	do	is	look	at	five	categories	of	experiments	,	each	of	which	challenges	an	old	assumption	of	philanthropy	.
The	first	is	mass	collaboration	,	represented	here	by	Wikipedia	.
Now	,	this	may	surprise	you	.
But	remember	,	philanthropy	is	about	giving	of	time	and	talent	,	not	just	money	.
Clay	Shirky	,	that	great	chronicler	of	everything	networked	,	has	captured	the	assumption	that	this	challenges	in	such	a	beautiful	way	.
He	said	,	``	We	have	lived	in	this	world	where	little	things	are	done	for	love	and	big	things	for	money	.
Now	we	have	Wikipedia	.
Suddenly	big	things	can	be	done	for	love	.	''
Watch	,	this	spring	,	for	Paul	Hawken	's	new	book	--	Author	and	entrepreneur	many	of	you	may	know	about	.
The	book	is	called	``	Blessed	Unrest	.	''
And	when	it	comes	out	,	a	series	of	wiki	sites	under	the	label	WISER	,	are	going	to	launch	at	the	same	time	.
WISER	stands	for	World	Index	for	Social	and	Environmental	Responsibility	.
WISER	sets	out	to	document	,	link	and	empower	what	Paul	calls	the	largest	movement	,	and	fastest-growing	movement	in	human	history	:	humanity	's	collective	immune	response	to	today	's	threats	.
Now	,	all	of	these	big	things	for	love	--	experiments	--	are	n't	going	to	take	off	.
But	the	ones	that	do	are	going	to	be	the	biggest	,	the	most	open	,	the	fastest	,	the	most	connected	form	of	philanthropy	in	human	history	.
Second	category	is	online	philanthropy	marketplaces	.
This	is	,	of	course	,	to	philanthropy	what	eBay	and	Amazon	are	to	commerce	.
Think	of	it	as	peer-to-peer	philanthropy	.
And	this	challenges	yet	another	assumption	,	which	is	that	organized	philanthropy	is	only	for	the	very	wealthy	.
Take	a	look	,	if	you	have	n't	,	at	DonorsChoose	.
Omidyar	Network	has	made	a	big	investment	in	DonorsChoose	.
It	's	one	of	the	best	known	of	these	new	marketplaces	where	a	donor	can	go	straight	into	a	classroom	and	connect	with	what	a	teacher	says	they	need	.
Take	a	look	at	Changing	the	Present	,	started	by	a	TEDster	,	next	time	you	need	a	wedding	present	or	a	holiday	present	.
GiveIndia	is	for	a	whole	country	.
And	it	goes	on	and	on	.
The	third	category	is	represented	by	Warren	Buffet	,	which	I	call	aggregated	giving	.
It	's	not	just	that	Warren	Buffet	was	so	amazingly	generous	in	that	historic	act	last	summer	.
It	's	that	he	challenged	another	assumption	,	that	every	giver	should	have	his	or	her	own	fund	or	foundation	.
There	are	now	,	today	,	so	many	new	funds	that	are	aggregating	giving	and	investing	,	bringing	together	people	around	a	common	goal	,	to	think	bigger	.
One	of	the	best	known	is	Acumen	Fund	,	led	by	Jacqueline	Novogratz	,	a	TEDster	who	got	a	big	boost	here	at	TED	.
But	there	are	many	others	:	New	Profit	in	Cambridge	,	New	School	's	Venture	Fund	in	Silicon	Valley	,	Venture	Philanthropy	Partners	in	Washington	,	Global	Fund	for	Women	in	San	Francisco	.
Take	a	look	at	these	.
These	funds	are	to	philanthropy	what	venture	capital	,	private	equity	,	and	eventually	mutual	funds	are	to	investing	,	but	with	a	twist	--	because	often	a	community	forms	around	these	funds	,	as	it	has	at	Acumen	and	other	places	.
Now	,	imagine	for	a	second	these	first	three	types	of	experiments	:	mass	collaboration	,	online	marketplaces	,	aggregated	giving	.
And	understand	how	they	help	us	re-perceive	what	organized	philanthropy	is	.
It	's	not	about	foundations	necessarily	;	it	's	about	the	rest	of	us	.
I	'm	going	to	look	quickly	at	the	fourth	and	fifth	categories	,	which	are	innovation	,	competitions	and	social	investing	.
They	're	betting	a	visible	competition	,	a	prize	,	can	attract	talent	and	money	to	some	of	the	most	difficult	issues	,	and	thereby	speed	the	solution	.
This	tackles	yet	another	assumption	,	that	the	giver	and	the	organization	is	at	the	center	,	as	opposed	to	putting	the	problem	at	the	center	.
You	can	look	to	these	innovators	to	help	us	especially	with	things	that	require	technological	or	scientific	solution	.
That	leaves	the	final	category	,	social	investing	,	which	is	really	,	anyway	,	the	biggest	of	them	all	,	represented	here	by	Xigi.net	.
And	this	,	of	course	,	tackles	the	biggest	assumption	of	all	,	that	business	is	business	,	and	philanthropy	is	the	vehicle	of	people	who	want	to	create	change	in	the	world	.
Xigi	is	a	new	community	site	that	's	built	by	the	community	,	linking	and	mapping	this	new	social	capital	market	.
It	lists	already	1,000	entities	that	are	offering	debt	and	equity	for	social	enterprise	.
So	we	can	look	to	these	innovators	to	help	us	remember	that	if	we	can	leverage	even	a	small	amount	of	the	capital	that	seeks	a	return	,	the	good	that	can	be	driven	could	be	astonishing	.
Now	,	what	's	really	interesting	here	is	that	we	're	not	thinking	our	way	into	a	new	way	of	acting	;	we	're	acting	our	way	into	a	new	way	of	thinking	.
Philanthropy	is	reorganizing	itself	before	our	very	eyes	.
And	even	though	all	of	the	experiments	and	all	of	the	big	givers	do	n't	yet	fulfill	this	aspiration	,	I	think	this	is	the	new	zeitgeist	:	open	,	big	,	fast	,	connected	,	and	,	let	us	also	hope	,	long	.
We	have	got	to	realize	that	it	is	going	to	take	a	long	time	to	do	these	things	.
If	we	do	n't	develop	the	stamina	to	stick	with	things	--	whatever	it	is	you	pick	,	stick	with	it	--	all	of	this	stuff	is	just	going	to	be	,	you	know	,	a	fad	.
But	I	'm	really	hopeful	.
And	I	'm	hopeful	because	it	's	not	only	philanthropy	that	's	reorganizing	itself	,	it	's	also	whole	other	portions	of	the	social	sector	,	and	of	business	,	that	are	busy	challenging	``	business	as	usual	.	''
And	everywhere	I	go	,	including	here	at	TED	,	I	feel	that	there	is	a	new	moral	hunger	that	is	growing	.
What	we	're	seeing	is	people	really	wrestling	to	describe	what	is	this	new	thing	that	's	happening	.
Words	like	``	philanthrocapitalism	,	''	and	``	natural	capitalism	,	''	and	``	philanthroentrepreneur	,	''	and	``	venture	philanthropy	.	''
We	do	n't	have	a	language	for	it	yet	.
Whatever	we	call	it	,	it	's	new	,	it	's	beginning	,	and	I	think	it	's	gong	to	quite	significant	.
And	that	's	where	my	imagined	future	comes	in	,	which	I	am	going	to	call	the	social	singularity	.
Many	of	you	will	realize	that	I	'm	ripping	a	bit	off	of	the	science	fiction	writer	Vernor	Vinge	's	notion	of	a	technological	singularity	,	where	a	number	of	trends	accelerate	and	converge	and	come	together	to	create	,	really	,	a	shockingly	new	reality	.
It	may	be	that	the	social	singularity	ahead	is	the	one	that	we	fear	the	most	:	a	convergence	of	catastrophes	,	of	environmental	degradation	,	of	weapons	of	mass	destruction	,	of	pandemics	,	of	poverty	.
That	's	because	our	ability	to	confront	the	problems	that	we	face	has	not	kept	pace	with	our	ability	to	create	them	.
And	as	we	've	heard	here	,	it	is	no	exaggeration	to	say	that	we	hold	the	future	of	our	civilization	in	our	hands	as	never	before	.
The	question	is	,	is	there	a	positive	social	singularity	?
Is	there	a	frontier	for	us	of	how	we	live	together	?
Our	future	does	n't	have	to	be	imagined	.
We	can	create	a	future	where	hope	and	history	rhyme	.
But	we	have	a	problem	.
Our	experience	to	date	,	both	individually	and	collectively	,	has	n't	prepared	us	for	what	we	're	going	to	need	to	do	,	or	who	we	're	going	to	need	to	be	.
We	are	going	to	need	a	new	generation	of	citizen	leaders	willing	to	commit	ourselves	to	growing	and	changing	and	learning	as	rapidly	as	possible	.
That	's	why	I	have	one	last	thing	I	want	to	show	you	.
This	is	a	photograph	taken	about	100	years	ago	of	my	grandfather	and	great-grandfather	.
This	is	a	newspaper	publisher	and	a	banker	.
And	they	were	great	community	leaders	.
And	,	yes	,	they	were	great	philanthropists	.
I	keep	this	photograph	close	by	to	me	--	it	's	in	my	office	--	because	I	've	always	felt	a	mystical	connection	to	these	two	men	,	both	of	whom	I	never	knew	.
And	so	,	in	their	honor	,	I	want	to	offer	you	this	blank	slide	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	this	a	photograph	of	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	think	about	the	community	that	you	want	to	be	part	of	creating	.
Whatever	that	means	to	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	it	's	100	years	from	now	,	and	your	grandchild	,	or	great-grandchild	,	or	niece	or	nephew	or	god-child	,	is	looking	at	this	photograph	of	you	.
What	is	the	story	you	most	want	for	them	to	tell	?
Thank	you	very	much	.

Hanna	Rosin	:	New	data	on	the	rise	of	women
We	are	now	going	through	an	amazing	and	unprecedented	moment	where	the	power	dynamics	between	men	and	women	are	shifting	very	rapidly	,	and	in	many	of	the	places	where	it	counts	the	most	,	women	are	,	in	fact	,	taking	control	of	everything	.
In	my	mother	's	day	,	she	did	n't	go	to	college	.
Not	a	lot	of	women	did	.
And	now	,	for	every	two	men	who	get	a	college	degree	,	three	women	will	do	the	same	.
Women	,	for	the	first	time	this	year	,	became	the	majority	of	the	American	workforce	.
And	they	're	starting	to	dominate	lots	of	professions	--	doctors	,	lawyers	,	bankers	,	accountants	.
Over	50	percent	of	managers	are	women	these	days	,	and	in	the	15	professions	projected	to	grow	the	most	in	the	next	decade	,	all	but	two	of	them	are	dominated	by	women	.
So	the	global	economy	is	becoming	a	place	where	women	are	more	successful	than	men	,	believe	it	or	not	,	and	these	economic	changes	are	starting	to	rapidly	affect	our	culture	--	what	our	romantic	comedies	look	like	,	what	our	marriages	look	like	,	what	our	dating	lives	look	like	,	and	our	new	set	of	superheroes	.
For	a	long	time	,	this	is	the	image	of	American	manhood	that	dominated	--	tough	,	rugged	,	in	control	of	his	own	environment	.
A	few	years	ago	,	the	Marlboro	Man	was	retired	and	replaced	by	this	much	less	impressive	specimen	,	who	is	a	parody	of	American	manhood	,	and	that	's	what	we	have	in	our	commercials	today	.
The	phrase	``	first-born	son	''	is	so	deeply	ingrained	in	our	consciousness	that	this	statistic	alone	shocked	me	.
In	American	fertility	clinics	,	75	percent	of	couples	are	requesting	girls	and	not	boys	.
And	in	places	where	you	would	n't	think	,	such	as	South	Korea	,	India	and	China	,	the	very	strict	patriarchal	societies	are	starting	to	break	down	a	little	,	and	families	are	no	longer	strongly	preferring	first-born	sons	.
If	you	think	about	this	,	if	you	just	open	your	eyes	to	this	possibility	and	start	to	connect	the	dots	,	you	can	see	the	evidence	everywhere	.
You	can	see	it	in	college	graduation	patterns	,	in	job	projections	,	in	our	marriage	statistics	,	you	can	see	it	in	the	Icelandic	elections	,	which	you	'll	hear	about	later	,	and	you	can	see	it	on	South	Korean	surveys	on	son	preference	,	that	something	amazing	and	unprecedented	is	happening	with	women	.
Certainly	this	is	not	the	first	time	that	we	've	had	great	progress	with	women	.
The	'20s	and	the	'60s	also	come	to	mind	.
But	the	difference	is	that	,	back	then	,	it	was	driven	by	a	very	passionate	feminist	movement	that	was	trying	to	project	its	own	desires	,	whereas	this	time	,	it	's	not	about	passion	,	and	it	's	not	about	any	kind	of	movement	.
This	is	really	just	about	the	facts	of	this	economic	moment	that	we	live	in	.
The	200,000-year	period	in	which	men	have	been	top	dog	is	truly	coming	to	an	end	,	believe	it	or	not	,	and	that	's	why	I	talk	about	the	``	end	of	men	.	''
Now	all	you	men	out	there	,	this	is	not	the	moment	where	you	tune	out	or	throw	some	tomatoes	,	because	the	point	is	that	this	is	happening	to	all	of	us	.
I	myself	have	a	husband	and	a	father	and	two	sons	whom	I	dearly	love	.
And	this	is	why	I	like	to	talk	about	this	,	because	if	we	do	n't	acknowledge	it	,	then	the	transition	will	be	pretty	painful	.
But	if	we	do	take	account	of	it	,	then	I	think	it	will	go	much	more	smoothly	.
I	first	started	thinking	about	this	about	a	year	and	a	half	ago	.
I	was	reading	headlines	about	the	recession	just	like	anyone	else	,	and	I	started	to	notice	a	distinct	pattern	--	that	the	recession	was	affecting	men	much	more	deeply	than	it	was	affecting	women	.
And	I	remembered	back	to	about	10	years	ago	when	I	read	a	book	by	Susan	Faludi	called	``	Stiffed	:	The	Betrayal	of	the	American	Man	,	''	in	which	she	described	how	hard	the	recession	had	hit	men	,	and	I	started	to	think	about	whether	it	had	gotten	worse	this	time	around	in	this	recession	.
And	I	realized	that	two	things	were	different	this	time	around	.
The	first	was	that	these	were	no	longer	just	temporary	hits	that	the	recession	was	giving	men	--	that	this	was	reflecting	a	deeper	underlying	shift	in	our	global	economy	.
And	second	,	that	the	story	was	no	longer	just	about	the	crisis	of	men	,	but	it	was	also	about	what	was	happening	to	women	.
And	now	look	at	this	second	set	of	slides	.
These	are	headlines	about	what	's	been	going	on	with	women	in	the	next	few	years	.
These	are	things	we	never	could	have	imagined	a	few	years	ago	.
Women	,	a	majority	of	the	workplace	.
And	labor	statistics	:	women	take	up	most	managerial	jobs	.
This	second	set	of	headlines	--	you	can	see	that	families	and	marriages	are	starting	to	shift	.
And	look	at	that	last	headline	--	young	women	earning	more	than	young	men	.
That	particular	headline	comes	to	me	from	a	market	research	firm	.
They	were	basically	asked	by	one	of	their	clients	who	was	going	to	buy	houses	in	that	neighborhood	in	the	future	.
And	they	expected	that	it	would	be	young	families	,	or	young	men	,	just	like	it	had	always	been	.
But	in	fact	,	they	found	something	very	surprising	.
It	was	young	,	single	women	who	were	the	major	purchasers	of	houses	in	the	neighborhood	.
And	so	they	decided	,	because	they	were	intrigued	by	this	finding	,	to	do	a	nationwide	survey	.
So	they	spread	out	all	the	census	data	,	and	what	they	found	,	the	guy	described	to	me	as	a	shocker	,	which	is	that	in	1,997	out	of	2,000	communities	,	women	,	young	women	,	were	making	more	money	than	young	men	.
So	here	you	have	a	generation	of	young	women	who	grow	up	thinking	of	themselves	as	being	more	powerful	earners	than	the	young	men	around	them	.
Now	,	I	've	just	laid	out	the	picture	for	you	,	but	I	still	have	n't	explained	to	you	why	this	is	happening	.
And	in	a	moment	,	I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	graph	,	and	what	you	'll	see	on	this	graph	--	it	begins	in	1973	,	just	before	women	start	flooding	the	workforce	,	and	it	brings	us	up	to	our	current	day	.
And	basically	what	you	'll	see	is	what	economists	talk	about	as	the	polarization	of	the	economy	.
Now	what	does	that	mean	?
It	means	that	the	economy	is	dividing	into	high-skill	,	high-wage	jobs	and	low-skill	,	low-wage	jobs	--	and	that	the	middle	,	the	middle-skill	jobs	,	and	the	middle-earning	jobs	,	are	starting	to	drop	out	of	the	economy	.
This	has	been	going	on	for	40	years	now	.
But	this	process	is	affecting	men	very	differently	than	it	's	affecting	women	.
You	'll	see	the	women	in	red	,	and	you	'll	see	the	men	in	blue	.
You	'll	watch	them	both	drop	out	of	the	middle	class	,	but	see	what	happens	to	women	and	see	what	happens	to	men	.
There	we	go	.
So	watch	that	.	You	see	them	both	drop	out	of	the	middle	class	.
Watch	what	happens	to	the	women	.	Watch	what	happens	to	the	men	.
The	men	sort	of	stagnate	there	,	while	the	women	zoom	up	in	those	high-skill	jobs	.
So	what	's	that	about	?
It	looks	like	women	got	some	power	boost	on	a	video	game	,	or	like	they	snuck	in	some	secret	serum	into	their	birth-control	pills	that	lets	them	shoot	up	high	.
But	of	course	,	it	's	not	about	that	.
What	it	's	about	is	that	the	economy	has	changed	a	lot	.
We	used	to	have	a	manufacturing	economy	,	which	was	about	building	goods	and	products	,	and	now	we	have	a	service	economy	and	an	information	and	creative	economy	.
Those	two	economies	require	very	different	skills	,	and	as	it	happens	,	women	have	been	much	better	at	acquiring	the	new	set	of	skills	than	men	have	been	.
It	used	to	be	that	you	were	a	guy	who	went	to	high	school	who	did	n't	have	a	college	degree	,	but	you	had	a	specific	set	of	skills	,	and	with	the	help	of	a	union	,	you	could	make	yourself	a	pretty	good	middle-class	life	.
But	that	really	is	n't	true	anymore	.
This	new	economy	is	pretty	indifferent	to	size	and	strength	,	which	is	what	's	helped	men	along	all	these	years	.
What	the	economy	requires	now	is	a	whole	different	set	of	skills	.
You	basically	need	intelligence	,	you	need	an	ability	to	sit	still	and	focus	,	to	communicate	openly	,	to	be	able	to	listen	to	people	and	to	operate	in	a	workplace	that	is	much	more	fluid	than	it	used	to	be	,	and	those	are	things	that	women	do	extremely	well	,	as	we	're	seeing	.
If	you	look	at	management	theory	these	days	,	it	used	to	be	that	our	ideal	leader	sounded	something	like	General	Patton	,	right	?
You	would	be	issuing	orders	from	above	.
You	would	be	very	hierarchical	.
You	would	tell	everyone	below	you	what	to	do	.
But	that	's	not	what	an	ideal	leader	is	like	now	.
If	you	read	management	books	now	,	a	leader	is	somebody	who	can	foster	creativity	,	who	can	get	his	--	get	the	employees	--	see	,	I	still	say	``	his	''	--	who	can	get	the	employees	to	talk	to	each	other	,	who	can	basically	build	teams	and	get	them	to	be	creative	.
And	those	are	all	things	that	women	do	very	well	.
And	then	on	top	of	that	,	that	's	created	a	kind	of	cascading	effect	.
Women	enter	the	workplace	at	the	top	,	and	then	at	the	working	class	,	all	the	new	jobs	that	are	created	are	the	kinds	of	jobs	that	wives	used	to	do	for	free	at	home	.
So	that	's	childcare	,	elder	care	and	food	preparation	.
So	those	are	all	the	jobs	that	are	growing	,	and	those	are	jobs	that	women	tend	to	do	.
Now	one	day	it	might	be	that	mothers	will	hire	an	out-of-work	,	middle-aged	,	former	steelworker	guy	to	watch	their	children	at	home	,	and	that	would	be	good	for	the	men	,	but	that	has	n't	quite	happened	yet	.
To	see	what	's	going	to	happen	,	you	ca	n't	just	look	at	the	workforce	that	is	now	,	you	have	to	look	at	our	future	workforce	.
And	here	the	story	is	fairly	simple	.
Women	are	getting	college	degrees	at	a	faster	rate	than	men	.
Why	?	This	is	a	real	mystery	.
People	have	asked	men	,	why	do	n't	they	just	go	back	to	college	,	to	community	college	,	say	,	and	retool	themselves	,	learn	a	new	set	of	skills	?
Well	it	turns	out	that	they	're	just	very	uncomfortable	doing	that	.
They	're	used	to	thinking	of	themselves	as	providers	,	and	they	ca	n't	seem	to	build	the	social	networks	that	allow	them	to	get	through	college	.
So	for	some	reason	men	just	do	n't	end	up	going	back	to	college	.
And	what	's	even	more	disturbing	is	what	's	happening	with	younger	boys	.
There	's	been	about	a	decade	of	research	about	what	people	are	calling	the	``	boy	crisis	.	''
Now	the	boy	crisis	is	this	idea	that	very	young	boys	,	for	whatever	reason	,	are	doing	worse	in	school	than	very	young	girls	,	and	people	have	theories	about	that	.
Is	it	because	we	have	an	excessively	verbal	curriculum	,	and	little	girls	are	better	at	that	than	little	boys	?
Or	that	we	require	kids	to	sit	still	too	much	,	and	so	boys	initially	feel	like	failures	?
And	some	people	say	it	's	because	,	in	9th	grade	,	boys	start	dropping	out	of	school	.
Because	I	'm	writing	a	book	about	all	this	,	I	'm	still	looking	into	it	,	so	I	do	n't	have	the	answer	.
But	in	the	mean	time	,	I	'm	going	to	call	on	the	worldwide	education	expert	,	who	's	my	10-year-old	daughter	,	Noah	,	to	talk	to	you	about	why	the	boys	in	her	class	do	worse	.
Noah	:	The	girls	are	obviously	smarter	.
I	mean	they	have	much	larger	vocabulary	.
They	learn	much	faster	.
They	are	more	controlled	.
On	the	board	today	for	losing	recess	tomorrow	,	only	boys	.
Hanna	Rosin	:	And	why	is	that	?
Noah	:	Why	?	They	were	just	not	listening	to	the	class	while	the	girls	sat	there	very	nicely	.
HR	:	So	there	you	go	.
This	whole	thesis	really	came	home	to	me	when	I	went	to	visit	a	college	in	Kansas	City	--	working-class	college	.
Certainly	,	when	I	was	in	college	,	I	had	certain	expectations	about	my	life	--	that	my	husband	and	I	would	both	work	,	and	that	we	would	equally	raise	the	children	.
But	these	college	girls	had	a	completely	different	view	of	their	future	.
Basically	,	the	way	they	said	it	to	me	is	that	they	would	be	working	18	hours	a	day	,	that	their	husband	would	maybe	have	a	job	,	but	that	mostly	he	would	be	at	home	taking	care	of	the	kiddies	.
And	this	was	kind	of	a	shocker	to	me	.
And	then	here	's	my	favorite	quote	from	one	of	the	girls	:	``	Men	are	the	new	ball	and	chain	.	''
Now	you	laugh	,	but	that	quote	has	kind	of	a	sting	to	it	,	right	?
And	I	think	the	reason	it	has	a	sting	is	because	thousands	of	years	of	history	do	n't	reverse	themselves	without	a	lot	of	pain	,	and	that	's	why	I	talk	about	us	all	going	through	this	together	.
The	night	after	I	talked	to	these	college	girls	,	I	also	went	to	a	men	's	group	in	Kansas	,	and	these	were	exactly	the	kind	of	victims	of	the	manufacturing	economy	which	I	spoke	to	you	about	earlier	.
They	were	men	who	had	been	contractors	,	or	they	had	been	building	houses	and	they	had	lost	their	jobs	after	the	housing	boom	,	and	they	were	in	this	group	because	they	were	failing	to	pay	their	child	support	.
And	the	instructor	was	up	there	in	the	class	explaining	to	them	all	the	ways	in	which	they	had	lost	their	identity	in	this	new	age	.
He	was	telling	them	they	no	longer	had	any	moral	authority	,	that	nobody	needed	them	for	emotional	support	anymore	,	and	they	were	not	really	the	providers	.
So	who	were	they	?
And	this	was	very	disheartening	for	them	.
And	what	he	did	was	he	wrote	down	on	the	board	``	$	85,000	,	''	and	he	said	,	``	That	's	her	salary	,	''	and	then	he	wrote	down	``	$	12,000	.	''
``	That	's	your	salary	.
So	who	's	the	man	now	?	''	he	asked	them	.
``	Who	's	the	damn	man	?
She	's	the	man	now	.	''
And	that	really	sent	a	shudder	through	the	room	.
And	that	's	part	of	the	reason	I	like	to	talk	about	this	,	because	I	think	it	can	be	pretty	painful	,	and	we	really	have	to	work	through	it	.
And	the	other	reason	it	's	kind	of	urgent	is	because	it	's	not	just	happening	in	the	U.S	.
It	's	happening	all	over	the	world	.
In	India	,	poor	women	are	learning	English	faster	than	their	male	counterparts	in	order	to	staff	the	new	call	centers	that	are	growing	in	India	.
In	China	,	a	lot	of	the	opening	up	of	private	entrepreneurship	is	happening	because	women	are	starting	businesses	,	small	businesses	,	faster	than	men	.
And	here	's	my	favorite	example	,	which	is	in	South	Korea	.
Over	several	decades	,	South	Korea	built	one	of	the	most	patriarchal	societies	we	know	about	.
They	basically	enshrined	the	second-class	status	of	women	in	the	civil	code	.
And	if	women	failed	to	birth	male	children	,	they	were	basically	treated	like	domestic	servants	.
And	sometimes	family	would	pray	to	the	spirits	to	kill	off	a	girl	child	so	they	could	have	a	male	child	.
But	over	the	'70s	and	'80s	,	the	South	Korea	government	decided	they	wanted	to	rapidly	industrialize	,	and	so	what	they	did	was	,	they	started	to	push	women	into	the	workforce	.
Now	they	've	been	asking	a	question	since	1985	:	``	How	strongly	do	you	prefer	a	first-born	son	?	''
And	now	look	at	the	chart	.
That	's	from	1985	to	2003	.
How	much	do	you	prefer	a	first-born	son	?
So	you	can	see	that	these	economic	changes	really	do	have	a	strong	effect	on	our	culture	.
Now	because	we	have	n't	fully	processed	this	information	,	it	's	kind	of	coming	back	to	us	in	our	pop	culture	in	these	kind	of	weird	and	exaggerated	ways	,	where	you	can	see	that	the	stereotypes	are	changing	.
And	so	we	have	on	the	male	side	what	one	of	my	colleagues	likes	to	call	the	``	omega	males	''	popping	up	,	who	are	the	males	who	are	romantically	challenged	losers	who	ca	n't	find	a	job	.
And	they	come	up	in	lots	of	different	forms	.
So	we	have	the	perpetual	adolescent	.
We	have	the	charmless	misanthrope	.
Then	we	have	our	Bud	Light	guy	who	's	the	happy	couch	potato	.
And	then	here	's	a	shocker	:	even	America	's	most	sexiest	man	alive	,	the	sexiest	man	alive	gets	romantically	played	these	days	in	a	movie	.
And	then	on	the	female	side	,	you	have	the	opposite	,	in	which	you	have	these	crazy	superhero	women	.
You	've	got	Lady	Gaga	.
You	've	got	our	new	James	Bond	,	who	's	Angelina	Jolie	.
And	it	's	not	just	for	the	young	,	right	?
Even	Helen	Mirren	can	hold	a	gun	these	days	.
And	so	it	feels	like	we	have	to	move	from	this	place	where	we	've	got	these	uber-exaggerated	images	into	something	that	feels	a	little	more	normal	.
So	for	a	long	time	in	the	economic	sphere	,	we	've	lived	with	the	term	``	glass	ceiling	.	''
Now	I	've	never	really	liked	this	term	.
For	one	thing	,	it	puts	men	and	women	in	a	really	antagonistic	relationship	with	one	another	,	because	the	men	are	these	devious	tricksters	up	there	who	've	put	up	this	glass	ceiling	.
And	we	're	always	below	the	glass	ceiling	,	the	women	.
And	we	have	a	lot	of	skill	and	experience	,	but	it	's	a	trick	,	so	how	are	you	supposed	to	prepare	to	get	through	that	glass	ceiling	?
And	also	,	``	shattering	the	glass	ceiling	''	is	a	terrible	phrase	.
would	pop	their	head	through	a	glass	ceiling	?
So	the	image	that	I	like	to	think	of	,	instead	of	glass	ceiling	,	is	the	high	bridge	.
It	's	definitely	terrifying	to	stand	at	the	foot	of	a	high	bridge	,	but	it	's	also	pretty	exhilarating	,	because	it	's	beautiful	up	there	,	and	you	're	looking	out	on	a	beautiful	view	.
And	the	great	thing	is	there	's	no	trick	like	with	the	glass	ceiling	.
There	's	no	man	or	woman	standing	in	the	middle	about	to	cut	the	cables	.
There	's	no	hole	in	the	middle	that	you	're	going	to	fall	through	.
And	the	great	thing	is	that	you	can	take	anyone	along	with	you	.
You	can	bring	your	husband	along	.
You	can	bring	your	friends	,	or	your	colleagues	,	or	your	babysitter	to	walk	along	with	you	.
And	husbands	can	drag	their	wives	across	,	if	their	wives	do	n't	feel	ready	.
But	the	point	about	the	high	bridge	is	that	you	have	to	have	the	confidence	to	know	that	you	deserve	to	be	on	that	bridge	,	that	you	have	all	the	skills	and	experience	you	need	in	order	to	walk	across	the	high	bridge	,	but	you	just	have	to	make	the	decision	to	take	the	first	step	and	do	it	.
Thanks	very	much	.

Designing	electronics	is	generally	cumbersome	and	expensive	--	or	was	,	until	Leah	Buechley	and	her	team	at	MIT	developed	tools	to	treat	electronics	just	like	paper	and	pen	.	In	this	talk	from	TEDYouth	2011	,	Buechley	shows	some	of	her	charming	designs	,	like	a	paper	piano	you	can	sketch	and	then	play	.

Leah	Buechley	:	How	to	“sketch”	with	electronics
Today	,	I	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	sketching	electronics	.
I	'm	,	among	several	other	things	,	an	electrical	engineer	,	and	that	means	that	I	spend	a	good	amount	of	time	designing	and	building	new	pieces	of	technology	,	and	more	specifically	designing	and	building	electronics	.
And	what	I	've	found	is	that	the	process	of	designing	and	building	electronics	is	problematic	in	all	sorts	of	ways	.
So	it	's	a	really	slow	process	,	it	's	really	expensive	,	and	the	outcome	of	that	process	,	namely	electronic	circuit	boards	,	are	limited	in	all	sorts	of	kind	of	interesting	ways	.
So	they	're	really	small	,	generally	,	they	're	square	and	flat	and	hard	,	and	frankly	,	most	of	them	just	are	n't	very	attractive	,	and	so	my	team	and	I	have	been	thinking	of	ways	to	really	change	and	mix	up	the	process	and	the	outcome	of	designing	electronics	.
And	so	what	if	you	could	design	and	build	electronics	like	this	?	So	what	if	you	could	do	it	extremely	quickly	,	extremely	inexpensively	,	and	maybe	more	interestingly	,	really	fluidly	and	expressively	and	even	improvisationally	?
Would	n't	that	be	so	cool	,	and	that	would	n't	that	open	up	all	sorts	of	new	possibilities	?
I	'm	going	to	share	with	you	two	projects	that	are	investigations	along	these	lines	,	and	we	'll	start	with	this	one	.
Magnetic	electronic	pieces	and	ferrous	paper	.
A	conductive	pen	from	the	Lewis	lab	at	UIUC	.
Sticker	templates	.
Speed	x	4	.
Making	a	switch	.
Music	:	DJ	Shadow	.
Adding	some	intelligence	with	a	microcontroller	.
Sketching	an	interface	.
Pretty	cool	,	huh	?	We	think	so	.
So	now	that	we	developed	these	tools	and	found	these	materials	that	let	us	do	these	things	,	we	started	to	realize	that	,	essentially	,	anything	that	we	can	do	with	paper	,	anything	that	we	can	do	with	a	piece	of	paper	and	a	pen	we	can	now	do	with	electronics	.
So	the	next	project	that	I	want	to	show	you	is	kind	of	a	deeper	exploration	of	that	possibility	.
And	I	'll	kind	of	let	it	speak	for	itself	.
So	the	next	step	for	us	in	this	process	is	now	to	find	a	way	to	let	all	of	you	build	things	like	this	,	and	so	the	way	that	we	're	approaching	that	is	by	teaching	workshops	to	people	where	we	explain	how	they	can	use	these	kinds	of	tools	,	and	then	also	working	to	get	the	tools	and	the	materials	and	techniques	out	into	the	real	world	in	a	variety	of	ways	.
And	so	sometime	soon	,	you	'll	be	able	to	play	and	build	and	sketch	with	electronics	in	this	fundamentally	new	way	.
So	thank	you	very	much	.

The	world	's	population	will	grow	to	9	billion	over	the	next	50	years	--	and	only	by	raising	the	living	standards	of	the	poorest	can	we	check	population	growth	.	This	is	the	paradoxical	answer	that	Hans	Rosling	unveils	at	TED	@	Cannes	using	colorful	new	data	display	technology	.

Hans	Rosling	on	global	population	growth
I	still	remember	the	day	in	school	when	our	teacher	told	us	that	the	world	population	had	become	three	billion	people	,	and	that	was	in	1960	.
I	'm	going	to	talk	now	about	how	world	population	has	changed	from	that	year	and	into	the	future	,	but	I	will	not	use	digital	technology	,	as	I	've	done	during	my	first	five	TEDTalks	.
Instead	,	I	have	progressed	,	and	I	am	,	today	,	launching	a	brand	new	analog	teaching	technology	that	I	picked	up	from	IKEA	:	this	box	.
This	box	contains	one	billion	people	.
And	our	teacher	told	us	that	the	industrialized	world	,	1960	,	had	one	billion	people	.
In	the	developing	world	,	she	said	,	they	had	two	billion	people	.
And	they	lived	away	then	.
There	was	a	big	gap	between	the	one	billion	in	the	industrialized	world	and	the	two	billion	in	the	developing	world	.
In	the	industrialized	world	,	people	were	healthy	,	educated	,	rich	,	and	they	had	small	families	.
And	their	aspiration	was	to	buy	a	car	.
And	in	1960	,	all	Swedes	were	saving	to	try	to	buy	a	Volvo	like	this	.
This	was	the	economic	level	at	which	Sweden	was	.
But	in	contrast	to	this	,	in	the	developing	world	,	far	away	,	the	aspiration	of	the	average	family	there	was	to	have	food	for	the	day	.
They	were	saving	to	be	able	to	buy	a	pair	of	shoes	.
There	was	an	enormous	gap	in	the	world	when	I	grew	up	.
And	this	gap	between	the	West	and	the	rest	has	created	a	mindset	of	the	world	,	which	we	still	use	linguistically	when	we	talk	about	``	the	West	''	and	``	the	Developing	World	.	''
But	the	world	has	changed	,	and	it	's	overdue	to	upgrade	that	mindset	and	that	taxonomy	of	the	world	,	and	to	understand	it	.
And	that	's	what	I	'm	going	to	show	you	,	because	since	1960	what	has	happened	in	the	world	up	to	2010	is	that	a	staggering	four	billion	people	have	been	added	to	the	world	population	.
Just	look	how	many	.
The	world	population	has	doubled	since	I	went	to	school	.
And	of	course	,	there	's	been	economic	growth	in	the	West	.
A	lot	of	companies	have	happened	to	grow	the	economy	,	so	the	Western	population	moved	over	to	here	.
And	now	their	aspiration	is	not	only	to	have	a	car	.
Now	they	want	to	have	a	holiday	on	a	very	remote	destination	and	they	want	to	fly	.
So	this	is	where	they	are	today	.
And	the	most	successful	of	the	developing	countries	,	they	have	moved	on	,	you	know	,	and	they	have	become	emerging	economies	,	we	call	them	.
They	are	now	buying	cars	.
And	what	happened	a	month	ago	was	that	the	Chinese	company	,	Geely	,	they	acquired	the	Volvo	company	,	and	then	finally	the	Swedes	understood	that	something	big	had	happened	in	the	world	.
So	there	they	are	.
And	the	tragedy	is	that	the	two	billion	over	here	that	is	struggling	for	food	and	shoes	,	they	are	still	almost	as	poor	as	they	were	50	years	ago	.
The	new	thing	is	that	we	have	the	biggest	pile	of	billions	,	the	three	billions	here	,	which	are	also	becoming	emerging	economies	,	because	they	are	quite	healthy	,	relatively	well-educated	,	and	they	already	also	have	two	to	three	children	per	woman	,	as	those	[	richer	also	]	have	.
And	their	aspiration	now	is	,	of	course	,	to	buy	a	bicycle	,	and	then	later	on	they	would	like	to	have	a	motorbike	also	.
But	this	is	the	world	we	have	today	,	no	longer	any	gap	.
But	the	distance	from	the	poorest	here	,	the	very	poorest	,	to	the	very	richest	over	here	is	wider	than	ever	.
But	there	is	a	continuous	world	from	walking	,	biking	,	driving	,	flying	--	there	are	people	on	all	levels	,	and	most	people	tend	to	be	somewhere	in	the	middle	.
This	is	the	new	world	we	have	today	in	2010	.
And	what	will	happen	in	the	future	?
Well	,	I	'm	going	to	project	into	2050	.
I	was	in	Shanghai	recently	,	and	I	listened	to	what	's	happening	in	China	,	and	it	's	pretty	sure	that	they	will	catch	up	,	just	as	Japan	did	.
All	the	projections	[	say	that	]	this	one	[	billion	]	will	[	only	]	grow	with	one	to	two	or	three	percent	.
[	But	this	second	]	grows	with	seven	,	eight	percent	,	and	then	they	will	end	up	here	.
They	will	start	flying	.
And	these	lower	or	middle	income	countries	,	the	emerging	income	countries	,	they	will	also	forge	forwards	economically	.
And	if	,	but	only	if	,	we	invest	in	the	right	green	technology	--	so	that	we	can	avoid	severe	climate	change	,	and	energy	can	still	be	relatively	cheap	--	then	they	will	move	all	the	way	up	here	.
And	they	will	start	to	buy	electric	cars	.
This	is	what	we	will	find	there	.
So	what	about	the	poorest	two	billion	?
What	about	the	poorest	two	billion	here	?
Will	they	move	on	?
Well	,	here	population	[	growth	]	comes	in	because	there	[	among	emerging	economies	]	we	already	have	two	to	three	children	per	woman	,	family	planning	is	widely	used	,	and	population	growth	is	coming	to	an	end	.
Here	[	among	the	poorest	]	,	population	is	growing	.
So	these	[	poorest	]	two	billion	will	,	in	the	next	decades	,	increase	to	three	billion	,	and	they	will	thereafter	increase	to	four	billion	.
There	is	nothing	--	but	a	nuclear	war	of	a	kind	we	've	never	seen	--	that	can	stop	this	[	growth	]	from	happening	.
Because	we	already	have	this	[	growth	]	in	process	.
But	if	,	and	only	if	,	[	the	poorest	]	get	out	of	poverty	,	they	get	education	,	they	get	improved	child	survival	,	they	can	buy	a	bicycle	and	a	cell	phone	and	come	[	to	live	]	here	,	then	population	growth	will	stop	in	2050	.
We	can	not	have	people	on	this	level	looking	for	food	and	shoes	because	then	we	get	continued	population	growth	.
And	let	me	show	you	why	by	converting	back	to	the	old-time	digital	technology	.
Here	I	have	on	the	screen	my	country	bubbles	.
Every	bubble	is	a	country	.	The	size	is	population	.
The	colors	show	the	continent	.
The	yellow	on	there	is	the	Americas	;	dark	blue	is	Africa	;	brown	is	Europe	;	green	is	the	Middle	East	and	this	light	blue	is	South	Asia	.
That	's	India	and	this	is	China	.	Size	is	population	.
Here	I	have	children	per	woman	:	two	children	,	four	children	,	six	children	,	eight	children	--	big	families	,	small	families	.
The	year	is	1960	.
And	down	here	,	child	survival	,	the	percentage	of	children	surviving	childhood	up	to	starting	school	:	60	percent	,	70	percent	,	80	percent	,	90	,	and	almost	100	percent	,	as	we	have	today	in	the	wealthiest	and	healthiest	countries	.
But	look	,	this	is	the	world	my	teacher	talked	about	in	1960	:	one	billion	Western	world	here	--	high	child-survival	,	small	families	--	and	all	the	rest	,	the	rainbow	of	developing	countries	,	with	very	large	families	and	poor	child	survival	.
What	has	happened	?	I	start	the	world	.	Here	we	go	.
Can	you	see	,	as	the	years	pass	by	,	child	survival	is	increasing	?
They	get	soap	,	hygiene	,	education	,	vaccination	,	penicillin	and	then	family	planning	.	Family	size	is	decreasing	.
[	When	]	they	get	up	to	90-percent	child	survival	,	then	families	decrease	,	and	most	of	the	Arab	countries	in	the	Middle	East	is	falling	down	there	[	to	small	families	]	.
Look	,	Bangladesh	catching	up	with	India	.
The	whole	emerging	world	joins	the	Western	world	with	good	child	survival	and	small	family	size	,	but	we	still	have	the	poorest	billion	.
Can	you	see	the	poorest	billion	,	those	[	two	]	boxes	I	had	over	here	?
They	are	still	up	here	.
And	they	still	have	a	child	survival	of	only	70	to	80	percent	,	meaning	that	if	you	have	six	children	born	,	there	will	be	at	least	four	who	survive	to	the	next	generation	.
And	the	population	will	double	in	one	generation	.
So	the	only	way	of	really	getting	world	population	[	growth	]	to	stop	is	to	continue	to	improve	child	survival	to	90	percent	.
That	's	why	investments	by	Gates	Foundation	,	UNICEF	and	aid	organizations	,	together	with	national	government	in	the	poorest	countries	,	are	so	good	;	because	they	are	actually	helping	us	to	reach	a	sustainable	population	size	of	the	world	.
We	can	stop	at	nine	billion	if	we	do	the	right	things	.
Child	survival	is	the	new	green	.
It	's	only	by	child	survival	that	we	will	stop	population	growth	.
And	will	it	happen	?
Well	,	I	'm	not	an	optimist	,	neither	am	I	a	pessimist	.
I	'm	a	very	serious	``	possibilist	.	''
It	's	a	new	category	where	we	take	emotion	apart	,	and	we	just	work	analytically	with	the	world	.
It	can	be	done	.
We	can	have	a	much	more	just	world	.
With	green	technology	and	with	investments	to	alleviate	poverty	,	and	global	governance	,	the	world	can	become	like	this	.
And	look	at	the	position	of	the	old	West	.
Remember	when	this	blue	box	was	all	alone	,	leading	the	world	,	living	its	own	life	.
This	will	not	happen	[	again	]	.
The	role	of	the	old	West	in	the	new	world	is	to	become	the	foundation	of	the	modern	world	--	nothing	more	,	nothing	less	.
But	it	's	a	very	important	role	.
Do	it	well	and	get	used	to	it	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

We	worry	that	IM	,	texting	,	Facebook	are	spoiling	human	intimacy	,	but	Stefana	Broadbent	's	research	shows	how	communication	tech	is	capable	of	cultivating	deeper	relationships	,	bringing	love	across	barriers	like	distance	and	workplace	rules	.

Stefana	Broadbent	:	How	the	Internet	enables	intimacy
I	believe	that	there	are	new	,	hidden	tensions	that	are	actually	happening	between	people	and	institutions	--	institutions	that	are	the	institutions	that	people	inhabit	in	their	daily	life	:	schools	,	hospitals	,	workplaces	,	factories	,	offices	,	etc	.
And	something	that	I	see	happening	is	something	that	I	would	like	to	call	a	sort	of	``	democratization	of	intimacy	.	''
And	what	do	I	mean	by	that	?
I	mean	that	what	people	are	doing	is	,	in	fact	,	they	are	sort	of	,	with	their	communication	channels	,	they	are	breaking	an	imposed	isolation	that	these	institutions	are	imposing	on	them	.
How	are	they	doing	this	?	They	're	doing	it	in	a	very	simple	way	,	by	calling	their	mom	from	work	,	by	IMing	from	their	office	to	their	friends	,	by	texting	under	the	desk	.
The	pictures	that	you	're	seeing	behind	me	are	people	that	I	visited	in	the	last	few	months	.
And	I	asked	them	to	come	along	with	the	person	they	communicate	with	most	.
And	somebody	brought	a	boyfriend	,	somebody	a	father	.
One	young	woman	brought	her	grandfather	.
For	20	years	,	I	've	been	looking	at	how	people	use	channels	such	as	email	,	the	mobile	phone	,	texting	,	etc	.
What	we	're	actually	going	to	see	is	that	,	fundamentally	,	people	are	communicating	on	a	regular	basis	with	five	,	six	,	seven	of	their	most	intimate	sphere	.
Now	,	lets	take	some	data	.	Facebook	.
Recently	some	sociologists	from	Facebook	--	Facebook	is	the	channel	that	you	would	expect	is	the	most	enlargening	of	all	channels	.
And	an	average	user	,	said	Cameron	Marlow	,	from	Facebook	,	has	about	120	friends	.
But	he	actually	talks	to	,	has	two-way	exchanges	with	,	about	four	to	six	people	on	a	regular	base	,	depending	on	his	gender	.
Academic	research	on	instant	messaging	also	shows	100	people	on	buddy	lists	,	but	fundamentally	people	chat	with	two	,	three	,	four	--	anyway	,	less	than	five	.
My	own	research	on	cellphones	and	voice	calls	shows	that	80	percent	of	the	calls	are	actually	made	to	four	people	.	80	percent	.
And	when	you	go	to	Skype	,	it	's	down	to	two	people	.
A	lot	of	sociologists	actually	are	quite	disappointed	.
I	mean	,	I	've	been	a	bit	disappointed	sometimes	when	I	saw	this	data	and	all	this	deployment	,	just	for	five	people	.
And	some	sociologists	actually	feel	that	it	's	a	closure	,	it	's	a	cocooning	,	that	we	're	disengaging	from	the	public	.
And	I	would	actually	,	I	would	like	to	show	you	that	if	we	actually	look	at	who	is	doing	it	,	and	from	where	they	're	doing	it	,	actually	there	is	an	incredible	social	transformation	.
There	are	three	stories	that	I	think	are	quite	good	examples	.
The	first	gentleman	,	he	's	a	baker	.
And	so	he	starts	working	every	morning	at	four	o'clock	in	the	morning	.
And	around	eight	o'clock	he	sort	of	sneaks	away	from	his	oven	,	cleans	his	hands	from	the	flour	and	calls	his	wife	.
He	just	wants	to	wish	her	a	good	day	,	because	that	's	the	start	of	her	day	.
And	I	've	heard	this	story	a	number	of	times	.
A	young	factory	worker	who	works	night	shifts	,	who	manages	to	sneak	away	from	the	factory	floor	,	where	there	is	CCTV	by	the	way	,	and	find	a	corner	,	where	at	11	o'clock	at	night	he	can	call	his	girlfriend	and	just	say	goodnight	.
Or	a	mother	who	,	at	four	o'clock	,	suddenly	manages	to	find	a	corner	in	the	toilet	to	check	that	her	children	are	safely	home	.
Then	there	is	another	couple	,	there	is	a	Brazilian	couple	.
They	've	lived	in	Italy	for	a	number	of	years	.
They	Skype	with	their	families	a	few	times	a	week	.
But	once	a	fortnight	,	they	actually	put	the	computer	on	their	dining	table	,	pull	out	the	webcam	and	actually	have	dinner	with	their	family	in	Sao	Paulo	.	And	they	have	a	big	event	of	it	.
And	I	heard	this	story	the	first	time	a	couple	of	years	ago	from	a	very	modest	family	of	immigrants	from	Kosovo	in	Switzerland	.
They	had	set	up	a	big	screen	in	their	living	room	,	and	every	morning	they	had	breakfast	with	their	grandmother	.
But	Danny	Miller	,	who	is	a	very	good	anthropologist	who	is	working	on	Filipina	migrant	women	who	leave	their	children	back	in	the	Philippines	,	was	telling	me	about	how	much	parenting	is	going	on	through	Skype	,	and	how	much	these	mothers	are	engaged	with	their	children	through	Skype	.
And	then	there	is	the	third	couple	.	They	are	two	friends	.
They	chat	to	each	other	every	day	,	a	few	times	a	day	actually	.
And	finally	,	finally	,	they	've	managed	to	put	instant	messaging	on	their	computers	at	work	.
And	now	,	obviously	,	they	have	it	open	.
Whenever	they	have	a	moment	they	chat	to	each	other	.
And	this	is	exactly	what	we	've	been	seeing	with	teenagers	and	kids	doing	it	in	school	,	under	the	table	,	and	texting	under	the	table	to	their	friends	.
So	,	none	of	these	cases	are	unique	.
I	mean	,	I	could	tell	you	hundreds	of	them	.
But	what	is	really	exceptional	is	the	setting	.
So	,	think	of	the	three	settings	I	've	talked	to	you	about	:	factory	,	migration	,	office	.
But	it	could	be	in	a	school	,	it	could	be	an	administration	,	it	could	be	a	hospital	.
Three	settings	that	,	if	we	just	step	back	15	years	,	if	you	just	think	back	15	years	,	when	you	clocked	in	,	when	you	clocked	in	to	an	office	,	when	you	clocked	in	to	a	factory	,	there	was	no	contact	for	the	whole	duration	of	the	time	,	there	was	no	contact	with	your	private	sphere	.
If	you	were	lucky	there	was	a	public	phone	hanging	in	the	corridor	or	somewhere	.
If	you	were	in	management	,	oh	,	that	was	a	different	story	.
Maybe	you	had	a	direct	line	.
If	you	were	not	,	you	maybe	had	to	go	through	an	operator	.
But	basically	,	when	you	walked	into	those	buildings	,	the	private	sphere	was	left	behind	you	.
And	this	has	become	such	a	norm	of	our	professional	lives	,	such	a	norm	and	such	an	expectation	.
And	it	had	nothing	to	do	with	technical	capability	.
The	phones	were	there	.	But	the	expectation	was	once	you	moved	in	there	your	commitment	was	fully	to	the	task	at	hand	,	fully	to	the	people	around	you	.
That	was	where	the	focus	had	to	be	.
And	this	has	become	such	a	cultural	norm	that	we	actually	school	our	children	for	them	to	be	capable	to	do	this	cleavage	.
If	you	think	nursery	,	kindergarten	,	first	years	of	school	are	just	dedicated	to	take	away	the	children	,	to	make	them	used	to	staying	long	hours	away	from	their	family	.
And	then	the	school	enacts	perfectly	well	.
It	mimics	perfectly	all	the	rituals	that	we	will	find	in	offices	:	rituals	of	entry	,	rituals	of	exit	,	the	schedules	,	the	uniforms	in	this	country	,	things	that	identify	you	,	team-building	activities	,	team	building	that	will	allow	you	to	basically	be	with	a	random	group	of	kids	,	or	a	random	group	of	people	that	you	will	have	to	be	with	for	a	number	of	time	.
And	of	course	,	the	major	thing	:	learn	to	pay	attention	,	to	concentrate	and	focus	your	attention	.
This	only	started	about	150	years	ago	.
It	only	started	with	the	birth	of	modern	bureaucracy	,	and	of	industrial	revolution	.
When	people	basically	had	to	go	somewhere	else	to	work	and	carry	out	the	work	.
And	when	with	modern	bureaucracy	there	was	a	very	rational	approach	,	where	there	was	a	clear	distinction	between	the	private	sphere	and	the	public	sphere	.
So	,	until	then	,	basically	people	were	living	on	top	of	their	trades	.
They	were	living	on	top	of	the	land	they	were	laboring	.
They	were	living	on	top	of	the	workshops	where	they	were	working	.
And	if	you	think	,	it	's	permeated	our	whole	culture	,	even	our	cities	.
If	you	think	of	medieval	cities	,	medieval	cities	the	boroughs	all	have	the	names	of	the	guilds	and	professions	that	lived	there	.
Now	we	have	sprawling	residential	suburbias	that	are	well	distinct	from	production	areas	and	commercial	areas	.
And	actually	,	over	these	150	years	,	there	has	been	a	very	clear	class	system	that	also	has	emerged	.
So	the	lower	the	status	of	the	job	and	of	the	person	carrying	out	,	the	more	removed	he	would	be	from	his	personal	sphere	.
People	have	taken	this	amazing	possibility	of	actually	being	in	contact	all	through	the	day	or	in	all	types	of	situations	.
And	they	are	doing	it	massively	.
The	Pew	Institute	,	which	produces	good	data	on	a	regular	basis	on	,	for	instance	,	in	the	States	,	says	that	--	and	I	think	that	this	number	is	conservative	--	50	percent	of	anybody	with	email	access	at	work	is	actually	doing	private	email	from	his	office	.
I	really	think	that	the	number	is	conservative	.
In	my	own	research	,	we	saw	that	the	peak	for	private	email	is	actually	11	o'clock	in	the	morning	,	whatever	the	country	.
75	percent	of	people	admit	doing	private	conversations	from	work	on	their	mobile	phones	.
100	percent	are	using	text	.
The	point	is	that	this	re-appropriation	of	the	personal	sphere	is	not	terribly	successful	with	all	institutions	.
I	'm	always	surprised	the	U.S.	Army	sociologists	are	discussing	of	the	impact	for	instance	,	of	soldiers	in	Iraq	having	daily	contact	with	their	families	.
But	there	are	many	institutions	that	are	actually	blocking	this	access	.
And	every	day	,	every	single	day	,	I	read	news	that	makes	me	cringe	,	like	a	$	15	fine	to	kids	in	Texas	,	for	using	,	every	time	they	take	out	their	mobile	phone	in	school	.
Immediate	dismissal	to	bus	drivers	in	New	York	,	if	seen	with	a	mobile	phone	in	a	hand	.
Companies	blocking	access	to	IM	or	to	Facebook	.
Behind	issues	of	security	and	safety	,	which	have	always	been	the	arguments	for	social	control	,	in	fact	what	is	going	on	is	that	these	institutions	are	trying	to	decide	who	,	in	fact	,	has	a	right	to	self	determine	their	attention	,	to	decide	,	whether	they	should	,	or	not	,	be	isolated	.
And	they	are	actually	trying	to	block	,	in	a	certain	sense	,	this	movement	of	a	greater	possibility	of	intimacy	.

Anthony	Atala	on	growing	new	organs
This	is	actually	a	painting	that	hangs	at	the	Countway	Library	at	Harvard	Medical	School	.
And	it	shows	the	first	time	an	organ	was	ever	transplanted	.
In	the	front	,	you	see	,	actually	,	Joe	Murray	getting	the	patient	ready	for	the	transplant	,	while	in	the	back	room	you	see	Hartwell	Harrison	,	the	Chief	of	Urology	at	Harvard	,	actually	harvesting	the	kidney	.
The	kidney	was	indeed	the	first	organ	ever	to	be	transplanted	to	the	human	.
That	was	back	in	1954	,	55	years	ago	.
Yet	we	're	still	dealing	with	a	lot	of	the	same	challenges	as	many	decades	ago	.
Certainly	many	advances	,	many	lives	saved	.
But	we	have	a	major	shortage	of	organs	.
In	the	last	decade	the	number	of	patients	waiting	for	a	transplant	has	doubled	.
While	,	at	the	same	time	,	the	actual	number	of	transplants	has	remained	almost	entirely	flat	.
That	really	has	to	do	with	our	aging	population	.
We	're	just	getting	older	.
Medicine	is	doing	a	better	job	of	keeping	us	alive	.
But	as	we	age	,	our	organs	tend	to	fail	more	.
So	,	that	's	a	challenge	,	not	just	for	organs	but	also	for	tissues	.
Trying	to	replace	pancreas	,	trying	to	replace	nerves	that	can	help	us	with	Parkinson	's	.
These	are	major	issues	.
This	is	actually	a	very	stunning	statistic	.
Every	30	seconds	a	patient	dies	from	diseases	that	could	be	treated	with	tissue	regeneration	or	replacement	.
So	,	what	can	we	do	about	it	?
We	've	talked	about	stem	cells	tonight	.
That	's	a	way	to	do	it	.
But	still	ways	to	go	to	get	stem	cells	into	patients	,	in	terms	of	actual	therapies	for	organs	.
Would	n't	it	be	great	if	our	bodies	could	regenerate	?
Would	n't	it	be	great	if	we	could	actually	harness	the	power	of	our	bodies	,	to	actually	heal	ourselves	?
It	's	not	really	that	foreign	of	a	concept	,	actually	;	it	happens	on	the	Earth	every	day	.
This	is	actually	a	picture	of	a	salamander	.
Salamanders	have	this	amazing	capacity	to	regenerate	.
You	see	here	a	little	video	.
This	is	actually	a	limb	injury	in	this	salamander	.
And	this	is	actually	real	photography	,	timed	photography	,	showing	how	that	limb	regenerates	in	a	period	of	days	.
You	see	the	scar	form	.
And	that	scar	actually	grows	out	a	new	limb	.
So	,	salamanders	can	do	it	.
Why	ca	n't	we	?	Why	ca	n't	humans	regenerate	?
Actually	,	we	can	regenerate	.
Your	body	has	many	organs	and	every	single	organ	in	your	body	has	a	cell	population	that	's	ready	to	take	over	at	the	time	of	injury	.	It	happens	every	day	.
As	you	age	,	as	you	get	older	.
Your	bones	regenerate	every	10	years	.
Your	skin	regenerates	every	two	weeks	.
So	,	your	body	is	constantly	regenerating	.
The	challenge	occurs	when	there	is	an	injury	.
At	the	time	of	injury	or	disease	,	the	body	's	first	reaction	is	to	seal	itself	off	from	the	rest	of	the	body	.
It	basically	wants	to	fight	off	infection	,	and	seal	itself	,	whether	it	's	organs	inside	your	body	,	or	your	skin	,	the	first	reaction	is	for	scar	tissue	to	move	in	,	to	seal	itself	off	from	the	outside	.
So	,	how	can	we	harness	that	power	?
One	of	the	ways	that	we	do	that	is	actually	by	using	smart	biomaterials	.
How	does	this	work	?	Well	,	on	the	left	side	here	you	see	a	urethra	which	was	injured	.
This	is	the	channel	that	connects	the	bladder	to	the	outside	of	the	body	.
And	you	see	that	it	is	injured	.
We	basically	found	out	that	you	can	use	these	smart	biomaterials	that	you	can	actually	use	as	a	bridge	.
If	you	build	that	bridge	,	and	you	close	off	from	the	outside	environment	,	then	you	can	create	that	bridge	,	and	cells	that	regenerate	in	your	body	,	can	then	cross	that	bridge	,	and	take	that	path	.
That	's	exactly	what	you	see	here	.
It	's	actually	a	smart	biomaterial	that	we	used	,	to	actually	treat	this	patient	.
This	was	an	injured	urethra	on	the	left	side	.
We	used	that	biomaterial	in	the	middle	.
And	then	,	six	months	later	on	the	right-hand	side	you	see	this	reengineered	urethra	.
Turns	out	your	body	can	regenerate	,	but	only	for	small	distances	.
The	maximum	efficient	distance	for	regeneration	is	only	about	one	centimeter	.
So	,	we	can	use	these	smart	biomaterials	but	only	for	about	one	centimeter	to	bridge	those	gaps	.
So	,	we	do	regenerate	,	but	for	limited	distances	.
What	do	we	do	now	,	if	you	have	injury	for	larger	organs	?
What	do	we	do	when	we	have	injuries	for	structures	which	are	much	larger	than	one	centimeter	?
Then	we	can	start	to	use	cells	.
The	strategy	here	,	is	if	a	patient	comes	in	to	us	with	a	diseased	or	injured	organ	,	you	can	take	a	very	small	piece	of	tissue	from	that	organ	,	less	than	half	the	size	of	a	postage	stamp	,	you	can	then	tease	that	tissue	apart	,	and	look	at	its	basic	components	,	the	patient	's	own	cells	,	you	take	those	cells	out	,	grow	and	expand	those	cells	outside	the	body	in	large	quantities	,	and	then	we	then	use	scaffold	materials	.
To	the	naked	eye	they	look	like	a	piece	of	your	blouse	,	or	your	shirt	,	but	actually	these	materials	are	fairly	complex	and	they	are	designed	to	degrade	once	inside	the	body	.
It	disintegrates	a	few	months	later	.
It	's	acting	only	as	a	cell	delivery	vehicle	.
It	's	bringing	the	cells	into	the	body	.	It	's	allowing	the	cells	to	regenerate	new	tissue	,	and	once	the	tissue	is	regenerated	the	scaffold	goes	away	.
And	that	's	what	we	did	for	this	piece	of	muscle	.
This	is	actually	showing	a	piece	of	muscle	and	how	we	go	through	the	structures	to	actually	engineer	the	muscle	.
We	take	the	cells	,	we	expand	them	,	we	place	the	cells	on	the	scaffold	,	and	we	then	place	the	scaffold	back	into	the	patient	.
But	actually	,	before	placing	the	scaffold	into	the	patient	,	we	actually	exercise	it	.
We	want	to	make	sure	that	we	condition	this	muscle	,	so	that	it	knows	what	to	do	once	we	put	it	into	the	patient	.
That	's	what	you	're	seeing	here	.	You	're	seeing	this	muscle	bio-reactor	actually	exercising	the	muscle	back	and	forth	.
Okay	.	These	are	flat	structures	that	we	see	here	,	the	muscle	.
What	about	other	structures	?
This	is	actually	an	engineered	blood	vessel	.
Very	similar	to	what	we	just	did	,	but	a	little	bit	more	complex	.
Here	we	take	a	scaffold	,	and	we	basically	--	scaffold	can	be	like	a	piece	of	paper	here	.
And	we	can	then	tubularize	this	scaffold	.
And	what	we	do	is	we	,	to	make	a	blood	vessel	,	same	strategy	.
A	blood	vessel	is	made	up	of	two	different	cell	types	.
We	take	muscle	cells	,	we	paste	,	or	coat	the	outside	with	these	muscle	cells	,	very	much	like	baking	a	layer	cake	,	if	you	will	.
You	place	the	muscle	cells	on	the	outside	.
You	place	the	vascular	blood	vessel	lining	cells	on	the	inside	.
You	now	have	your	fully	seeded	scaffold	.
You	're	going	to	place	this	in	an	oven-like	device	.
It	has	the	same	conditions	as	a	human	body	,	37	degrees	centigrade	,	95	percent	oxygen	.
You	then	exercise	it	,	as	what	you	saw	on	that	tape	.
And	on	the	right	you	actually	see	a	carotid	artery	that	was	engineered	.
This	is	actually	the	artery	that	goes	from	your	neck	to	your	brain	.
And	this	is	an	X-ray	showing	you	the	patent	,	functional	blood	vessel	.
More	complex	structures	such	as	blood	vessels	,	urethras	,	which	I	showed	you	,	they	're	definitely	more	complex	because	you	're	introducing	two	different	cell	types	.
But	they	are	really	acting	mostly	as	conduits	.
You	're	allowing	fluid	or	air	to	go	through	at	steady	states	.
They	are	not	nearly	as	complex	as	hollow	organs	.
Hollow	organs	have	a	much	higher	degree	of	complexity	,	because	you	're	asking	these	organs	to	act	on	demand	.
So	,	the	bladder	is	one	such	organ	.
Same	strategy	,	we	take	a	very	small	piece	of	the	bladder	,	less	than	half	the	size	of	a	postage	stamp	.
We	then	tease	the	tissue	apart	into	its	two	individual	cell	components	,	muscle	,	and	these	bladder	specialized	cells	.
We	grow	the	cells	outside	the	body	in	large	quantities	.
It	takes	about	four	weeks	to	grow	these	cells	from	the	organ	.
We	then	take	a	scaffold	that	we	shape	like	a	bladder	.
We	coat	the	inside	with	these	bladder	lining	cells	.
We	coat	the	outside	with	these	muscle	cells	.
We	place	it	back	into	this	oven-like	device	.
From	the	time	you	take	that	piece	of	tissue	,	six	to	eight	weeks	later	you	can	put	the	organ	right	back	into	the	patient	.
This	actually	shows	the	scaffold	.
The	material	is	actually	being	coated	with	the	cells	.
When	we	did	the	first	clinical	trial	for	these	patients	we	actually	created	the	scaffold	specifically	for	each	patient	.
We	brought	patients	in	,	six	to	eight	weeks	prior	to	their	scheduled	surgery	,	did	X-rays	,	and	we	then	composed	a	scaffold	specifically	for	that	patient	's	size	For	the	second	phase	of	the	trials	we	just	had	different	sizes	,	small	,	medium	,	large	and	extra-large	.
It	's	true	.
And	I	'm	sure	everyone	here	wanted	an	extra-large	.	Right	?
So	,	bladders	are	definitely	a	little	bit	more	complex	than	the	other	structures	.
But	there	are	other	hollow	organs	that	have	added	complexity	to	it	.
This	is	actually	a	heart	valve	,	which	we	engineered	.
And	the	way	you	engineer	this	heart	valve	is	the	same	strategy	.
We	take	the	scaffold	,	we	seed	it	with	cells	,	and	you	can	now	see	here	,	the	valve	leaflets	opening	and	closing	.
We	exercise	these	prior	to	implantation	.
Same	strategy	.
And	then	the	most	complex	are	the	solid	organs	.
For	solid	organs	,	they	're	more	complex	because	you	're	using	a	lot	more	cells	per	centimeter	.
This	is	actually	a	simple	solid	organ	like	the	ear	.
It	's	now	being	seeded	with	cartilage	.
That	's	the	oven-like	device	;	once	it	's	coated	it	gets	placed	there	.
And	then	a	few	weeks	later	we	can	take	out	the	cartilage	scaffold	.
This	is	actually	digits	that	we	're	engineering	.
These	are	being	layered	,	one	layer	at	a	time	,	first	the	bone	,	we	fill	in	the	gaps	with	cartilage	.
We	then	start	adding	the	muscle	on	top	.
And	you	start	layering	these	solid	structures	.
Again	,	fairly	more	complex	organs	,	but	by	far	,	the	most	complex	solid	organs	are	actually	the	vascularized	,	highly	vascularized	,	a	lot	of	blood	vessel	supply	,	organs	such	as	the	heart	,	the	liver	,	the	kidneys	.
This	is	actually	an	example	--	several	strategies	to	engineer	solid	organs	.
This	is	actually	one	of	the	strategies	.	We	use	a	printer	.
And	instead	of	using	ink	,	we	use	--	you	just	saw	an	inkjet	cartridge	--	we	just	use	cells	.
This	is	actually	your	typical	desktop	printer	.
It	's	actually	printing	this	two	chamber	heart	,	one	layer	at	a	time	.
You	see	the	heart	coming	out	there	.	It	takes	about	40	minutes	to	print	,	and	about	four	to	six	hours	later	you	see	the	muscle	cells	contract	.
This	technology	was	developed	by	Tao	Ju	,	who	worked	at	our	institute	.
And	this	is	actually	still	,	of	course	,	experimental	,	not	for	use	in	patients	.
Another	strategy	that	we	have	followed	is	actually	to	use	decellularized	organs	.
We	actually	take	donor	organs	,	organs	that	are	discarded	,	and	we	then	can	use	very	mild	detergents	to	take	all	the	cell	elements	out	of	these	organs	.
So	,	for	example	on	the	left	panel	,	top	panel	,	you	see	a	liver	.
We	actually	take	the	donor	liver	,	we	use	very	mild	detergents	,	and	we	,	by	using	these	mild	detergents	,	we	take	all	the	cells	out	of	the	liver	.
Two	weeks	later	,	we	basically	can	lift	this	organ	up	,	it	feels	like	a	liver	,	we	can	hold	it	like	a	liver	,	it	looks	like	a	liver	,	but	it	has	no	cells	.
All	we	are	left	with	is	the	skeleton	,	if	you	will	,	of	the	liver	,	all	made	up	of	collagen	,	a	material	that	's	in	our	bodies	,	that	will	not	reject	.
We	can	use	it	from	one	patient	to	the	next	.
We	then	take	this	vascular	structure	and	we	can	prove	that	we	retain	the	blood	vessel	supply	.
You	can	see	,	actually	that	's	a	fluoroscopy	.
We	're	actually	injecting	contrast	into	the	organ	.
Now	you	can	see	it	start	.	We	're	injecting	the	contrast	into	the	organ	into	this	decellularized	liver	.
And	you	can	see	the	vascular	tree	that	remains	intact	.
We	then	take	the	cells	,	the	vascular	cells	,	blood	vessel	cells	,	we	perfuse	the	vascular	tree	with	the	patient	's	own	cells	.
We	perfuse	the	outside	of	the	liver	with	the	patient	's	own	liver	cells	.
And	we	can	then	create	functional	livers	.
And	that	's	actually	what	you	're	seeing	.
This	is	still	experimental	.	But	we	are	able	to	actually	reproduce	the	functionality	of	the	liver	structure	,	experimentally	.
For	the	kidney	,	as	I	talked	to	you	about	the	first	painting	that	you	saw	,	the	first	slide	I	showed	you	,	90	percent	of	the	patients	on	the	transplant	wait	list	are	waiting	for	a	kidney	,	90	percent	.
So	,	another	strategy	we	're	following	is	actually	to	create	wafers	that	we	stack	together	,	like	an	accordion	,	if	you	will	.
So	,	we	stack	these	wafers	together	,	using	the	kidney	cells	.
And	then	you	can	see	these	miniature	kidneys	that	we	've	engineered	.
They	are	actually	making	urine	.
Again	,	small	structures	,	our	challenge	is	how	to	make	them	larger	,	and	that	is	something	we	're	working	on	right	now	at	the	institute	.
One	of	the	things	that	I	wanted	to	summarize	for	you	then	is	what	is	a	strategy	that	we	're	going	for	in	regenerative	medicine	.
If	at	all	possible	,	we	really	would	like	to	use	smart	biomaterials	that	we	can	just	take	off	the	shelf	and	regenerate	your	organs	.
We	are	limited	with	distances	right	now	,	but	our	goal	is	actually	to	increase	those	distances	over	time	.
If	we	can	not	use	smart	biomaterials	,	then	we	'd	rather	use	your	very	own	cells	.
Why	?	Because	they	will	not	reject	.
We	can	take	cells	from	you	,	create	the	structure	,	put	it	right	back	into	you	,	they	will	not	reject	.
And	if	possible	,	we	'd	rather	use	the	cells	from	your	very	specific	organ	.
If	you	present	with	a	diseased	wind	pipe	we	'd	like	to	take	cells	from	your	windpipe	.
If	you	present	with	a	diseased	pancreas	we	'd	like	to	take	cells	from	that	organ	.
Why	?	Because	we	'd	rather	take	those	cells	which	already	know	that	those	are	the	cell	types	you	want	.
A	windpipe	cell	already	knows	it	's	a	windpipe	cell	.
We	do	n't	need	to	teach	it	to	become	another	cell	type	.
So	,	we	prefer	organ-specific	cells	.
And	today	we	can	obtain	cells	from	most	every	organ	in	your	body	,	except	for	several	which	we	still	need	stem	cells	for	,	like	heart	,	liver	,	nerve	and	pancreas	.
And	for	those	we	still	need	stem	cells	.
If	we	can	not	use	stem	cells	from	your	body	then	we	'd	like	to	use	donor	stem	cells	.
And	we	prefer	cells	that	will	not	reject	and	will	not	form	tumors	.
And	we	're	working	a	lot	with	the	stem	cells	that	we	published	on	two	years	ago	,	stem	cells	from	the	amniotic	fluid	,	and	the	placenta	,	which	have	those	properties	.
So	,	at	this	point	,	I	do	want	to	tell	you	that	some	of	the	major	challenges	we	have	.
You	know	,	I	just	showed	you	this	presentation	,	everything	looks	so	good	,	everything	works	.	Actually	no	,	these	technologies	really	are	not	that	easy	.
Some	of	the	work	you	saw	today	was	performed	by	over	700	researchers	at	our	institute	across	a	20-year	time	span	.
So	,	these	are	very	tough	technologies	.
Once	you	get	the	formula	right	you	can	replicate	it	.
But	it	takes	a	lot	to	get	there	.
So	,	I	always	like	to	show	this	cartoon	.
This	is	how	to	stop	a	runaway	stage	.
And	there	you	see	the	stagecoach	driver	,	and	he	goes	,	on	the	top	panel	,	He	goes	A	,	B	,	C	,	D	,	E	,	F	.
He	finally	stops	the	runaway	stage	.
And	those	are	usually	the	basic	scientists	,	The	bottom	is	usually	the	surgeons	.
I	'm	a	surgeon	so	that	's	not	that	funny	.
But	actually	method	A	is	the	correct	approach	.
And	what	I	mean	by	that	is	that	anytime	we	've	launched	one	of	these	technologies	to	the	clinic	,	we	've	made	absolutely	sure	that	we	do	everything	we	can	in	the	laboratory	before	we	ever	launch	these	technologies	to	patients	.
And	when	we	launch	these	technologies	to	patients	we	want	to	make	sure	that	we	ask	ourselves	a	very	tough	question	.
Are	you	ready	to	place	this	in	your	own	loved	one	,	your	own	child	,	your	own	family	member	,	and	then	we	proceed	.
Because	our	main	goal	,	of	course	,	is	first	,	to	do	no	harm	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	now	,	a	very	short	clip	,	It	's	a	five	second	clip	of	a	patient	who	received	one	of	the	engineered	organs	.
We	started	implanting	some	of	these	structures	over	14	years	ago	.
So	,	we	have	patients	now	walking	around	with	organs	,	engineered	organs	,	for	over	10	years	,	as	well	.
I	'm	going	to	show	a	clip	of	one	young	lady	.
She	had	a	spina	bifida	defect	,	a	spinal	cord	abnormality	.
She	did	not	have	a	normal	bladder	.	This	is	a	segment	from	CNN	.
We	are	just	taking	five	seconds	.
This	is	a	segment	that	Sanjay	Gupta	actually	took	care	of	.
Video	:	Kaitlyn	M	:	I	'm	happy	.	I	was	always	afraid	that	I	was	going	to	have	like	,	an	accident	or	something	.
And	now	I	can	just	go	and	go	out	with	my	friends	,	go	do	whatever	I	want	.
Anthony	Atala	:	See	,	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	the	promise	of	regenerative	medicine	is	a	single	promise	.
And	that	is	really	very	simple	,	to	make	our	patients	better	.
Thank	you	for	your	attention	.

Cameron	Herold	:	Let	's	raise	kids	to	be	entrepreneurs
I	would	be	willing	to	bet	that	I	'm	the	dumbest	guy	in	the	room	because	I	could	n't	get	through	school	.	I	struggled	with	school	.
It	's	not	something	that	is	a	bad	thing	and	is	vilified	,	which	is	what	happens	in	a	lot	of	society	.
Kids	,	when	we	grow	up	,	have	dreams	,	and	we	have	passions	,	and	we	have	visions	,	and	somehow	we	get	those	things	crushed	.
We	get	told	that	we	need	to	study	harder	or	be	more	focused	or	get	a	tutor	.
My	parents	got	me	a	tutor	in	French	,	and	I	still	suck	in	French	.
Two	years	ago	,	I	was	the	highest-rated	lecturer	at	MIT	's	entrepreneurial	master	's	program	.
And	it	was	a	speaking	event	in	front	of	groups	of	entrepreneurs	from	around	the	world	.
When	I	was	in	grade	two	,	I	won	a	city-wide	speaking	competition	,	but	nobody	had	ever	said	,	``	Hey	,	this	kid	's	a	good	speaker	.
He	ca	n't	focus	,	but	he	loves	walking	around	and	getting	people	energized	.	''
No	one	said	,	``	Get	him	a	coach	in	speaking	.	''
They	said	,	get	me	a	tutor	in	what	I	suck	at	.
So	as	kids	show	these	traits	--	and	we	need	to	start	looking	for	them	--	I	think	we	should	be	raising	kids	to	be	entrepreneurs	instead	of	lawyers	.
Unfortunately	the	school	system	is	grooming	this	world	to	say	,	``	Hey	,	let	's	be	a	lawyer	or	let	's	be	a	doctor	,	''	and	we	're	missing	that	opportunity	because	no	one	ever	says	,	``	Hey	,	be	an	entrepreneur	.	''
Entrepreneurs	are	people	--	because	we	have	a	lot	of	them	in	this	room	--	who	have	these	ideas	and	these	passions	or	see	these	needs	in	the	world	and	we	decide	to	stand	up	and	do	it	.
And	we	put	everything	on	the	line	to	make	that	stuff	happen	.
We	have	the	ability	to	get	those	groups	of	people	around	us	that	want	to	kind	of	build	that	dream	with	us	,	and	I	think	if	we	could	get	kids	to	embrace	the	idea	at	a	young	age	of	being	entrepreneurial	,	we	could	change	everything	in	the	world	that	is	a	problem	today	.
Every	problem	that	's	out	there	,	somebody	has	the	idea	for	.
And	as	a	young	kid	,	nobody	can	say	it	ca	n't	happen	because	you	're	too	dumb	to	realize	that	you	could	n't	figure	it	out	.
I	think	we	have	an	obligation	as	parents	and	a	society	to	start	teaching	our	kids	to	fish	instead	of	giving	them	the	fish	--	the	old	parable	:	``	If	you	give	a	man	a	fish	,	you	feed	him	for	a	day	.
If	you	teach	a	man	to	fish	,	you	feed	him	for	a	lifetime	.	''
If	we	can	teach	our	kids	to	become	entrepreneurial	--	the	ones	that	show	those	traits	to	be	--	like	we	teach	the	ones	who	have	science	gifts	to	go	on	in	science	,	what	if	we	saw	the	ones	who	had	entrepreneurial	traits	and	taught	them	to	be	entrepreneurs	?
We	could	actually	have	all	these	kids	spreading	businesses	instead	of	waiting	for	government	handouts	.
What	we	do	is	we	sit	and	teach	our	kids	all	the	things	they	should	n't	do	:	Do	n't	hit	;	do	n't	bite	;	do	n't	swear	.
Right	now	we	teach	our	kids	to	go	after	really	good	jobs	,	you	know	,	and	the	school	system	teaches	them	to	go	after	things	like	being	a	doctor	and	being	a	lawyer	and	being	an	accountant	and	a	dentist	and	a	teacher	and	a	pilot	.
And	the	media	says	that	it	's	really	cool	if	we	could	go	out	and	be	a	model	or	a	singer	or	a	sports	hero	like	Luongo	,	Crosby	.
Our	MBA	programs	do	not	teach	kids	to	be	entrepreneurs	.
The	reason	that	I	avoided	an	MBA	program	--	other	than	the	fact	that	I	could	n't	get	into	any	because	I	had	a	61	percent	average	out	of	high	school	and	then	61	percent	average	at	the	only	school	in	Canada	that	accepted	me	,	Carlton	--	but	our	MBA	programs	do	n't	teach	kids	to	be	entrepreneurs	.
They	teach	them	to	go	work	in	corporations	.
So	who	's	starting	these	companies	?	It	's	these	random	few	people	.
Even	in	popular	literature	,	the	only	book	I	've	ever	found	--	and	this	should	be	on	all	of	your	reading	lists	--	the	only	book	I	've	ever	found	that	makes	the	entrepreneur	into	the	hero	is	``	Atlas	Shrugged	.	''
Everything	else	in	the	world	tends	to	look	at	entrepreneurs	and	say	that	we	're	bad	people	.
I	look	at	even	my	family	.
Both	my	grandfathers	were	entrepreneurs	.	My	dad	was	an	entrepreneur	.
Both	my	brother	and	sister	and	I	,	all	three	of	us	own	companies	as	well	.
And	we	all	decided	to	start	these	things	because	it	's	really	the	only	place	we	fit	.
We	did	n't	fit	in	the	normal	work	.	We	could	n't	work	for	somebody	else	because	we	're	too	stubborn	and	we	have	all	these	other	traits	.
But	kids	could	be	entrepreneurs	as	well	.
I	'm	a	big	part	of	a	couple	organizations	globally	called	the	Entrepreneurs	'	Organization	and	the	Young	Presidents	'	Organization	.
I	just	came	back	from	speaking	in	Barcelona	at	the	YPO	global	conference	,	and	everyone	that	I	met	over	there	who	's	an	entrepreneur	struggled	with	school	.
I	have	18	out	of	the	19	signs	of	attention	deficit	disorder	diagnosed	.
So	this	thing	right	here	is	freaking	me	out	.
It	's	probably	why	I	'm	a	little	bit	panicked	right	now	--	other	than	all	the	caffeine	that	I	've	had	and	the	sugar	--	but	this	is	really	creepy	for	an	entrepreneur	.
Attention	deficit	disorder	,	bipolar	disorder	.
Do	you	know	that	bipolar	disorder	is	nicknamed	the	CEO	disease	?
Ted	Turner	's	got	it	.	Steve	Jobs	has	it	.
All	three	of	the	founders	of	Netscape	had	it	.
I	could	go	on	and	on	.
Kids	--	you	can	see	these	signs	in	kids	.
And	what	we	're	doing	is	we	're	giving	them	Ritalin	and	saying	,	``	Do	n't	be	an	entrepreneurial	type	.
Fit	into	this	other	system	and	try	to	become	a	student	.	''
Sorry	,	entrepreneurs	are	n't	students	.
We	fast-track	.	We	figure	out	the	game	.
I	stole	essays	.	I	cheated	on	exams	.
I	hired	kids	to	do	my	accounting	assignments	in	university	for	13	consecutive	assignments	.
But	as	an	entrepreneur	you	do	n't	do	accounting	,	you	hire	accountants	.
So	I	just	figured	that	out	earlier	.
At	least	I	can	admit	I	cheated	in	university	;	most	of	you	wo	n't	.
I	'm	also	quoted	--	and	I	told	the	person	who	wrote	the	textbook	--	I	'm	now	quoted	in	that	exact	same	university	textbook	in	every	Canadian	university	and	college	studies	.
In	managerial	accounting	,	I	'm	chapter	eight	.
I	open	up	chapter	eight	talking	about	budgeting	.
And	I	told	the	author	,	after	they	did	my	interview	,	that	I	cheated	in	that	same	course	.
And	she	thought	it	was	too	funny	to	not	include	it	anyway	.
But	kids	,	you	can	see	these	signs	in	them	.
The	definition	of	an	entrepreneur	is	``	a	person	who	organizes	,	operates	and	assumes	the	risk	of	a	business	venture	.	''
That	does	n't	mean	you	have	to	go	to	an	MBA	program	.
It	does	n't	mean	you	have	to	get	through	school	.
It	just	means	that	those	few	things	have	to	feel	right	in	your	gut	.
And	we	've	heard	those	things	about	``	is	it	nurture	or	is	it	nature	,	''	right	?
Is	it	thing	one	or	thing	two	?	What	is	it	?
Well	,	I	do	n't	think	it	's	either	.	I	think	it	can	be	both	.
I	was	groomed	as	an	entrepreneur	.
When	I	was	growing	up	as	a	young	kid	,	I	had	no	choice	,	because	I	was	taught	at	a	very	early	,	young	age	--	when	my	dad	realized	I	was	n't	going	to	fit	into	everything	else	that	was	being	taught	to	me	in	school	--	that	he	could	teach	me	to	figure	out	business	at	an	early	age	.
He	groomed	us	,	the	three	of	us	,	to	hate	the	thought	of	having	a	job	and	to	love	the	fact	of	creating	companies	that	we	could	employ	other	people	.
My	first	little	business	venture	:	I	was	seven	years	old	,	I	was	in	Winnipeg	,	and	I	was	lying	in	my	bedroom	with	one	of	those	long	extension	cords	.
And	I	was	calling	all	the	dry	cleaners	in	Winnipeg	to	find	out	how	much	would	the	dry	cleaners	pay	me	for	coat	hangers	.
And	my	mom	came	into	the	room	and	she	said	,	``	Where	are	you	going	to	get	the	coat	hangers	to	sell	to	the	dry	cleaners	?	''
And	I	said	,	``	Let	's	go	and	look	in	the	basement	.	''
And	we	went	down	to	the	basement	.	And	I	opened	up	this	cupboard	.
And	there	was	about	a	thousand	coat	hangers	that	I	'd	collected	.
Because	,	when	I	told	her	I	was	going	out	to	play	with	the	kids	,	I	was	going	door	to	door	in	the	neighborhood	to	collect	coat	hangers	to	put	in	the	basement	to	sell	.
Because	I	saw	her	a	few	weeks	before	that	--	you	could	get	paid	.	They	used	to	pay	you	two	cents	per	coat	hanger	.
So	I	was	just	like	,	well	there	's	all	kinds	of	coat	hangers	.
And	so	I	'll	just	go	get	them	.
And	I	knew	she	would	n't	want	me	to	go	get	them	,	so	I	just	did	it	anyway	.
And	I	learned	that	you	could	actually	negotiate	with	people	.
This	one	person	offered	me	three	cents	and	I	got	him	up	to	three	and	a	half	.
I	even	knew	at	a	seven-year-old	age	that	I	could	actually	get	a	fractional	percent	of	a	cent	,	and	people	would	pay	that	because	it	multiplied	up	.
At	seven	years	old	I	figured	it	out	.	I	got	three	and	a	half	cents	for	a	thousand	coat	hangers	.
I	sold	license	plate	protectors	door	to	door	.
My	dad	actually	made	me	go	find	someone	who	would	sell	me	these	things	at	wholesale	.
And	at	nine	years	old	,	I	walked	around	in	the	city	of	Sudbury	selling	license	plate	protectors	door	to	door	to	houses	.
And	I	remember	this	one	customer	so	vividly	because	I	also	did	some	other	stuff	with	these	clients	.
I	sold	newspapers	.
And	he	would	n't	buy	a	newspaper	from	me	ever	.
But	I	was	convinced	I	was	going	to	get	him	to	buy	a	license	plate	protector	.
And	he	's	like	,	``	Well	,	we	do	n't	need	one	.	''
And	I	said	,	``	But	you	've	got	two	cars	...	''	--	I	'm	nine	years	old	.
I	'm	like	,	``	But	you	have	two	cars	and	they	do	n't	have	license	plate	protectors	.	''
And	he	said	,	``	I	know	.	''
And	I	said	,	``	This	car	here	's	got	one	license	plate	that	's	all	crumpled	up	.	''
And	he	said	,	``	Yes	,	that	's	my	wife	's	car	.	''	And	I	said	,	``	Why	do	n't	we	just	test	one	on	the	front	of	your	wife	's	car	and	see	if	it	lasts	longer	.	''
So	I	knew	there	were	two	cars	with	two	license	plates	on	each	.
If	I	could	n't	sell	all	four	,	I	could	at	least	get	one	.
I	learned	that	at	a	young	age	.
I	did	comic	book	arbitrage	.
When	I	was	about	10	years	old	,	I	sold	comic	books	out	of	our	cottage	on	Georgian	Bay	.
And	I	would	go	biking	up	to	the	end	of	the	beach	and	buy	all	the	comics	from	the	poor	kids	.
And	then	I	would	go	back	to	the	other	end	of	the	beach	and	sell	them	to	the	rich	kids	.
But	it	was	obvious	to	me	,	right	?	Buy	low	,	sell	high	.
You	've	got	this	demand	over	here	that	has	money	.
Do	n't	try	to	sell	to	the	poor	kids	;	they	do	n't	have	cash	.	The	rich	people	do	.	Go	get	some	.
So	that	's	obvious	,	right	.
It	's	like	a	recession	.	So	,	there	's	a	recession	.
There	's	still	13	trillion	dollars	circulating	in	the	U.S.	economy	.
Go	get	some	of	that	.	And	I	learned	that	at	a	young	age	.
I	also	learned	,	do	n't	reveal	your	source	,	because	I	got	beat	up	after	about	four	weeks	of	doing	this	because	one	of	the	rich	kids	found	out	where	I	was	buying	my	comics	from	,	and	he	did	n't	like	the	fact	that	he	was	paying	a	lot	more	.
I	was	forced	to	get	a	paper	route	at	10	years	old	.
I	did	n't	really	want	a	paper	route	,	but	at	10	,	my	dad	said	,	``	That	's	going	to	be	your	next	business	.	''
So	not	only	would	he	get	me	one	,	but	I	had	to	get	two	,	and	then	he	wanted	me	to	hire	someone	to	deliver	half	the	papers	,	which	I	did	,	and	then	I	realized	that	collecting	tips	was	where	you	made	all	the	money	.
So	I	would	collect	the	tips	and	get	payment	.
So	I	would	go	and	collect	for	all	the	papers	.
He	could	just	deliver	them	.
Because	then	I	realized	I	could	make	the	money	.
By	this	point	,	I	was	definitely	not	going	to	be	an	employee	.
My	dad	owned	an	automotive	and	industrial	repair	shop	.
He	had	all	these	old	automotive	parts	lying	around	.
They	had	this	old	brass	and	copper	.
I	asked	him	what	he	did	with	it	,	and	he	said	he	just	throws	it	out	.
I	said	,	``	But	would	n't	somebody	pay	you	for	that	?	''	And	he	goes	,	``	Maybe	.	''
Remember	at	10	years	old	--	so	34	years	ago	I	saw	opportunity	in	this	stuff	.
I	saw	there	was	money	in	garbage	.
And	I	was	actually	collecting	it	from	all	the	automotive	shops	in	the	area	on	my	bicycle	.
And	then	my	dad	would	drive	me	on	Saturdays	to	a	scrap	metal	recycler	where	I	got	paid	.
And	I	thought	that	was	kind	of	cool	.
Strangely	enough	,	30	years	later	,	we	're	building	1-800-GOT-JUNK	?
and	making	money	off	that	too	.
I	built	these	little	pincushions	when	I	was	11	years	old	in	Cubs	,	and	we	made	these	pin	cushions	for	our	moms	for	Mother	's	Day	.
And	you	made	these	pincushions	out	of	wooden	clothespins	--	when	we	used	to	hang	clothes	on	clotheslines	outside	.
And	you	'd	make	these	chairs	.
And	I	had	these	little	pillows	that	I	would	sew	up	.
And	you	could	stuff	pins	in	them	.
Because	people	used	to	sew	and	they	needed	a	pin	cushion	.
But	what	I	realized	was	that	you	had	to	have	options	.
So	I	actually	spray	painted	a	whole	bunch	of	them	brown	.
And	then	when	I	went	to	the	door	,	it	was	n't	,	``	Do	you	want	to	buy	one	?	''
It	was	,	``	Which	color	would	you	like	?	''
Like	I	'm	10	years	old	;	you	're	not	going	to	say	no	to	me	,	especially	if	you	have	two	options	--	you	have	the	brown	one	or	the	clear	one	.
So	I	learned	that	lesson	at	a	young	age	.
I	learned	that	manual	labor	really	sucks	.
Right	,	like	cutting	lawns	is	brutal	.
But	because	I	had	to	cut	lawns	all	summer	for	all	of	our	neighbors	and	get	paid	to	do	that	,	I	realized	that	recurring	revenue	from	one	client	is	amazing	.
That	if	I	land	this	client	once	,	and	every	week	I	get	paid	by	that	person	,	that	's	way	better	than	trying	to	sell	one	clothespin	thing	to	one	person	.
Because	you	ca	n't	sell	them	more	.
So	I	love	that	recurring	revenue	model	I	started	to	learn	at	a	young	age	.
Remember	,	I	was	being	groomed	to	do	this	.	I	was	not	allowed	to	have	jobs	.
I	would	caddy	,	I	would	go	to	the	golf	course	and	caddy	for	people	.
But	I	realized	that	there	was	this	one	hill	on	our	golf	course	,	the	13th	hole	that	had	this	huge	hill	.
And	people	could	never	get	their	bags	up	it	.
So	I	would	sit	there	with	a	lawn	chair	and	just	carry	up	all	the	people	who	did	n't	have	caddies	.
I	would	carry	their	golf	bags	up	to	the	top	,	and	they	'd	pay	me	a	dollar	.
Meanwhile	,	my	friends	were	working	for	five	hours	to	haul	some	guy	's	bag	around	and	get	paid	10	bucks	.
I	'm	like	,	``	That	's	stupid	because	you	have	to	work	for	five	hours	.
That	does	n't	make	any	sense	.	''	You	just	figure	out	a	way	to	make	more	money	faster	.
Every	week	,	I	would	go	to	the	corner	store	and	buy	all	these	pops	.
Then	I	would	go	up	and	deliver	them	to	these	70-year-old	women	playing	bridge	.
And	they	'd	give	me	their	orders	for	the	following	week	.
And	then	I	'd	just	deliver	pop	and	I	'd	just	charge	twice	.
And	I	had	this	captured	market	.	You	did	n't	need	contracts	.
You	just	needed	to	have	a	supply	and	demand	and	this	audience	who	bought	into	you	.
These	women	were	n't	going	to	go	to	anybody	else	because	they	liked	me	,	and	I	kind	of	figured	it	out	.
I	went	and	got	golf	balls	from	golf	courses	.
But	everybody	else	was	looking	in	the	bush	and	looking	in	the	ditches	for	golf	balls	.
I	'm	like	,	screw	that	.	They	're	all	in	the	pond	and	nobody	's	going	into	the	pond	.
So	I	would	go	into	the	ponds	and	crawl	around	and	pick	them	up	with	my	toes	.
You	just	pick	them	up	with	both	feet	.
You	ca	n't	do	it	on	stage	.
You	get	the	golf	balls	,	and	you	just	throw	them	in	your	bathing	suit	trunks	and	when	you	're	done	you	've	got	a	couple	hundred	of	them	.
But	the	problem	is	that	people	all	did	n't	want	all	the	golf	balls	.
So	I	just	packaged	them	.	I	'm	like	12	,	right	?
I	packaged	them	up	three	ways	.
I	had	the	Pinnacles	and	DDHs	and	the	really	cool	ones	back	then	.
Those	sold	for	two	dollars	each	.
And	then	I	had	all	the	good	ones	that	did	n't	look	crappy	.	They	were	50	cents	each	.
And	then	I	'd	sell	50	at	a	time	of	all	the	crappy	ones	.
And	they	could	use	those	for	practice	balls	.
I	sold	sunglasses	,	when	I	was	in	school	,	to	all	the	kids	in	high	school	.
This	is	what	really	kind	of	gets	everybody	hating	you	is	because	you	're	trying	to	extract	money	from	all	your	friends	all	the	time	.
But	it	paid	the	bills	.
So	I	sold	lots	and	lots	of	sunglasses	.
Then	when	the	school	shut	me	down	--	the	school	actually	called	me	into	the	office	and	told	me	I	could	n't	do	it	--	so	I	went	to	the	gas	stations	and	I	sold	lots	of	them	to	the	gas	stations	and	had	the	gas	stations	sell	them	to	their	customers	.
That	was	cool	because	then	I	had	retail	outlets	.
And	I	think	I	was	14	.
Then	I	paid	my	entire	way	through	first	year	university	at	Carlton	by	selling	wine	skins	door	to	door	.
You	know	that	you	can	hold	a	40-ounce	bottle	of	rum	and	two	bottles	of	coke	in	a	wineskin	?	So	what	,	right	?
Yeah	,	but	you	know	what	?	You	stuff	that	down	your	shorts	,	when	you	go	into	a	football	game	you	can	get	booze	in	for	free	,	everybody	bought	them	.
Supply	,	demand	,	big	opportunity	.
I	also	branded	it	,	so	I	sold	them	for	five	times	the	normal	cost	.
It	had	our	university	logo	on	it	.
You	know	we	teach	our	kids	and	we	buy	them	games	,	but	why	do	n't	we	get	them	games	,	if	they	're	entrepreneurial	kids	,	that	kind	of	nurture	the	traits	that	you	need	to	be	entrepreneurs	?
Why	do	n't	you	teach	them	not	to	waste	money	?
I	remember	being	told	to	walk	out	in	the	middle	of	a	street	in	Banff	,	Alberta	because	I	'd	thrown	a	penny	out	in	the	street	,	and	my	dad	said	,	``	Go	pick	it	up	.	''
He	said	,	``	I	work	too	damn	hard	for	my	money	.	I	'm	not	going	to	see	you	ever	waste	a	penny	.	''
And	I	remember	that	lesson	to	this	day	.
Allowances	teach	kids	the	wrong	habits	.
Allowances	,	by	nature	,	are	teaching	kids	to	think	about	a	job	.
An	entrepreneur	does	n't	expect	a	regular	paycheck	.
Allowance	is	breeding	kids	at	a	young	age	to	expect	a	regular	paycheck	.
That	's	wrong	,	for	me	,	if	you	want	to	raise	entrepreneurs	.
What	I	do	with	my	kids	now	--	I	've	got	two	,	nine	and	seven	--	is	I	teach	them	to	walk	around	the	house	and	the	yard	,	looking	for	stuff	that	needs	to	get	done	.
Come	to	me	and	tell	me	what	it	is	.
Or	I	'll	come	to	them	and	say	,	``	Here	's	what	I	need	done	.	''
And	then	you	know	what	we	do	?	We	negotiate	.
They	go	around	looking	for	what	it	is	.
But	then	we	negotiate	on	what	they	're	going	to	get	paid	.
And	then	they	do	n't	have	a	regular	check	,	but	they	have	more	opportunities	to	find	more	stuff	,	and	they	learn	the	skill	of	negotiating	,	and	they	learn	the	skill	of	finding	opportunities	as	well	.
You	breed	that	kind	of	stuff	.	Each	of	my	kids	has	two	piggy	banks	.
Fifty	percent	of	all	the	money	that	they	earn	or	get	gifted	,	50	percent	goes	in	their	house	account	,	50	percent	goes	in	their	toy	account	.
Anything	in	their	toy	account	they	can	spend	on	whatever	they	want	.
The	50	percent	that	goes	in	their	house	account	,	every	six	months	,	goes	to	the	bank	.
They	walk	up	with	me	.	Every	year	all	the	money	in	the	bank	goes	to	their	broker	.
Both	my	nine-	and	seven-year-olds	have	a	stock	broker	already	.
But	I	'm	teaching	them	to	force	that	savings	habit	.
It	drives	me	crazy	that	30-year-olds	are	saying	,	``	Maybe	I	'll	start	contributing	to	my	RSP	now	.	''
Shit	,	you	've	missed	25	years	.
You	can	teach	those	habits	to	young	kids	when	they	do	n't	even	feel	the	pain	yet	.
Do	n't	read	them	bedtime	stories	every	night	.
Maybe	four	nights	out	of	the	week	read	them	bedtime	stories	and	three	nights	of	the	week	have	them	tell	stories	.
Why	do	n't	you	sit	down	with	kids	and	give	them	four	items	,	a	red	shirt	,	a	blue	tie	,	a	kangaroo	and	a	laptop	,	and	have	them	tell	a	story	about	those	four	things	?
My	kids	do	that	all	the	time	.
It	teaches	them	to	sell	;	it	teaches	them	creativity	;	it	teaches	them	to	think	on	their	feet	.
Just	do	that	kind	of	stuff	and	have	fun	with	it	.
Get	kids	to	stand	up	in	front	of	groups	and	talk	,	even	if	it	's	just	stand	up	in	front	of	their	friends	and	do	plays	and	have	speeches	.
Those	are	entrepreneurial	traits	that	you	want	to	be	nurturing	.
Show	the	kids	what	bad	customers	or	bad	employees	look	like	.
Show	them	the	grumpy	employees	.
When	you	see	grumpy	customer	service	,	point	that	out	to	them	.
Say	,	``	By	the	way	,	that	guy	's	a	crappy	employee	.	''
And	say	,	``	These	ones	are	good	ones	.	''
If	you	go	into	a	restaurant	and	you	have	bad	customer	service	,	show	them	what	bad	customer	service	looks	like	.
We	have	all	these	lessons	in	front	of	us	,	but	we	do	n't	take	those	opportunities	;	we	teach	kids	to	go	get	a	tutor	.
Imagine	if	you	actually	took	all	the	kids	'	junk	that	's	in	the	house	right	now	,	all	the	toys	that	they	've	outgrown	two	years	ago	and	said	,	``	Why	do	n't	we	start	selling	some	of	this	on	Craigslist	and	Kijiji	?	''
And	they	can	actually	sell	it	and	learn	how	to	find	scammers	when	they	get	email	offers	come	in	.
They	can	come	into	your	account	or	a	sub	account	or	whatever	.
But	teach	them	how	to	fix	the	price	,	guess	the	price	,	pull	up	the	photos	.
Teach	them	how	to	do	that	kind	of	stuff	and	make	money	.
Then	the	money	they	get	,	50	percent	goes	in	their	house	account	,	50	percent	goes	in	their	toy	account	.
My	kids	love	this	stuff	.
Some	of	the	entrepreneurial	traits	that	you	've	got	to	nurture	in	kids	:	attainment	,	tenacity	,	leadership	,	introspection	,	interdependence	,	values	.
All	these	traits	you	can	find	in	young	kids	,	and	you	can	help	nurture	them	.
Look	for	that	kind	of	stuff	.
There	's	two	traits	that	I	want	you	to	also	look	out	for	that	we	do	n't	kind	of	get	out	of	their	system	.
Do	n't	medicate	kids	for	attention	deficit	disorder	unless	it	is	really	,	really	freaking	bad	.
The	same	with	the	whole	things	on	mania	and	stress	and	depression	,	unless	it	is	so	clinically	brutal	,	man	.
Bipolar	disorder	is	nicknamed	the	CEO	disease	.
When	Steve	Jurvetson	and	Jim	Clark	and	Jim	Barksdale	have	all	got	it	,	and	they	built	Netscape	--	imagine	if	they	were	given	Ritalin	.
We	would	n't	have	have	that	stuff	,	right	?
Al	Gore	really	would	have	had	to	invented	the	Internet	.
These	skills	are	the	skills	we	should	be	teaching	in	the	classroom	as	well	as	everything	else	.
I	'm	not	saying	do	n't	get	kids	to	want	to	be	lawyers	.
But	how	about	getting	entrepreneurship	to	be	ranked	right	up	there	with	the	rest	of	them	as	well	?
Because	there	's	huge	opportunities	in	that	.
I	want	to	close	with	a	quick	little	video	.
It	's	a	video	that	was	done	by	one	of	the	companies	that	I	mentor	.
These	guys	,	Grasshopper	.
It	's	about	kids	.	It	's	about	entrepreneurship	.
Hopefully	this	inspires	you	to	take	what	you	've	heard	from	me	and	do	something	with	it	to	change	the	world	.

Majora	Carter	:	3	stories	of	local	eco-entrepreneurship
So	today	,	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	some	people	who	did	n't	move	out	of	their	neighborhoods	.
The	first	one	is	happening	right	here	in	Chicago	.
Brenda	Palms-Farber	was	hired	to	help	ex-convicts	reenter	society	and	keep	them	from	going	back	into	prison	.
Currently	,	taxpayers	spend	about	60,000	dollars	per	year	sending	a	person	to	jail	.
We	know	that	two-thirds	of	them	are	going	to	go	back	.
I	find	it	interesting	that	,	for	every	one	dollar	we	spend	,	however	,	on	early	childhood	education	,	like	Head	Start	,	we	save	17	dollars	on	stuff	like	incarceration	in	the	future	.
Or	--	think	about	it	--	that	60,000	dollars	is	more	than	what	it	costs	to	send	one	person	to	Harvard	as	well	.
But	Brenda	,	not	being	phased	by	stuff	like	that	,	took	a	look	at	her	challenge	and	came	up	with	a	not-so-obvious	solution	:	create	a	business	that	produces	skin	care	products	from	honey	.
Okay	,	it	might	be	obvious	to	some	of	you	;	it	was	n't	to	me	.
It	's	the	basis	of	growing	a	form	of	social	innovation	that	has	real	potential	.
She	hired	seemingly	unemployable	men	and	women	to	care	for	the	bees	,	harvest	the	honey	and	make	value-added	products	that	they	marketed	themselves	,	and	that	were	later	sold	at	Whole	Foods	.
She	combined	employment	experience	and	training	with	life	skills	they	needed	,	like	anger-management	and	teamwork	,	and	also	how	to	talk	to	future	employers	about	how	their	experiences	actually	demonstrated	the	lessons	that	they	had	learned	and	their	eagerness	to	learn	more	.
Less	than	four	percent	of	the	folks	that	went	through	her	program	actually	go	back	to	jail	.
So	these	young	men	and	women	learned	job-readiness	and	life	skills	through	bee	keeping	and	became	productive	citizens	in	the	process	.
Talk	about	a	sweet	beginning	.
Now	,	I	'm	going	to	take	you	to	Los	Angeles	,	and	lots	of	people	know	that	L.A.	has	its	issues	.
But	I	'm	going	to	talk	about	L.A.	's	water	issues	right	now	.
They	have	not	enough	water	on	most	days	and	too	much	to	handle	when	it	rains	.
Currently	,	20	percent	of	California	's	energy	consumption	is	used	to	pump	water	into	mostly	Southern	California	.
Their	spending	loads	,	loads	,	to	channel	that	rainwater	out	into	the	ocean	when	it	rains	and	floods	as	well	.
Now	Andy	Lipkis	is	working	to	help	L.A.	cut	infrastructure	costs	associated	with	water	management	and	urban	heat	island	--	linking	trees	,	people	and	technology	to	create	a	more	livable	city	.
All	that	green	stuff	actually	naturally	absorbs	storm	water	,	also	helps	cool	our	cities	.
Because	,	come	to	think	about	it	,	do	you	really	want	air-conditioning	,	or	is	it	a	cooler	room	that	you	want	?
How	you	get	it	should	n't	make	that	much	of	a	difference	.
So	a	few	years	ago	,	L.A.	County	decided	that	they	needed	to	spend	2.5	billion	dollars	to	repair	the	city	schools	.
And	Andy	and	his	team	discovered	that	they	were	going	to	spend	200	million	of	those	dollars	on	asphalt	to	surround	the	schools	themselves	.
And	by	presenting	a	really	strong	economic	case	,	they	convinced	the	L.A.	government	that	replacing	that	asphalt	with	trees	and	other	greenery	,	that	the	schools	themselves	would	save	the	system	more	on	energy	than	they	spend	on	horticultural	infrastructure	.
So	ultimately	,	20	million	square	feet	of	asphalt	was	replaced	or	avoided	,	and	electrical	consumption	for	air-conditioning	went	down	,	while	employment	for	people	to	maintain	those	grounds	went	up	,	resulting	in	a	net-savings	to	the	system	,	but	also	healthier	students	and	schools	system	employees	as	well	.
Now	Judy	Bonds	is	a	coal	miner	's	daughter	.
Her	family	has	eight	generations	in	a	town	called	Whitesville	,	West	Virginia	.
And	if	anyone	should	be	clinging	to	the	former	glory	of	the	coal	mining	history	,	and	of	the	town	,	it	should	be	Judy	.
But	the	way	coal	is	mined	right	now	is	different	from	the	deep	mines	that	her	father	and	her	father	's	father	would	go	down	into	and	that	employed	essentially	thousands	and	thousands	of	people	.
Now	,	two	dozen	men	can	tear	down	a	mountain	in	several	months	,	and	only	for	about	a	few	years	'	worth	of	coal	.
That	kind	of	technology	is	called	``	mountaintop	removal	.	''
It	can	make	a	mountain	go	from	this	to	this	in	a	few	short	months	.
Just	imagine	that	the	air	surrounding	these	places	--	it	's	filled	with	the	residue	of	explosives	and	coal	.
When	we	visited	,	it	gave	some	of	the	people	we	were	with	this	strange	little	cough	after	being	only	there	for	just	a	few	hours	or	so	--	not	just	miners	,	but	everybody	.
And	Judy	saw	her	landscape	being	destroyed	and	her	water	poisoned	.
And	the	coal	companies	just	move	on	after	the	mountain	was	emptied	,	leaving	even	more	unemployment	in	their	wake	.
But	she	also	saw	the	difference	in	potential	wind	energy	on	an	intact	mountain	,	and	one	that	was	reduced	in	elevation	by	over	2,000	feet	.
Three	years	of	dirty	energy	with	not	many	jobs	,	or	centuries	of	clean	energy	with	the	potential	for	developing	expertise	and	improvements	in	efficiency	based	on	technical	skills	,	and	developing	local	knowledge	about	how	to	get	the	most	out	of	that	region	's	wind	.
She	calculated	the	up-front	cost	and	the	payback	over	time	,	and	it	's	a	net-plus	on	so	many	levels	for	the	local	,	national	and	global	economy	.
It	's	a	longer	payback	than	mountaintop	removal	,	but	the	wind	energy	actually	pays	back	forever	.
Now	mountaintop	removal	pays	very	little	money	to	the	locals	,	and	it	gives	them	a	lot	of	misery	.
The	water	is	turned	into	goo	.
Most	people	are	still	unemployed	,	leading	to	most	of	the	same	kinds	of	social	problems	that	unemployed	people	in	inner	cities	also	experience	--	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	domestic	abuse	,	teen	pregnancy	and	poor	heath	,	as	well	.
Now	Judy	and	I	--	I	have	to	say	--	totally	related	to	each	other	.
Not	quite	an	obvious	alliance	.
I	mean	,	literally	,	her	hometown	is	called	Whitesville	,	West	Virginia	.
I	mean	,	they	are	not	--	they	ai	n't	competing	for	the	birthplace	of	hip	hop	title	or	anything	like	that	.
But	the	back	of	my	T-shirt	,	the	one	that	she	gave	me	,	says	,	``	Save	the	endangered	hillbillies	.	''
So	homegirls	and	hillbillies	we	got	it	together	and	totally	understand	that	this	is	what	it	's	all	about	.
But	just	a	few	months	ago	,	Judy	was	diagnosed	with	stage-three	lung	cancer	.
Yeah	.
And	it	has	since	moved	to	her	bones	and	her	brain	.
And	I	just	find	it	so	bizarre	that	she	's	suffering	from	the	same	thing	that	she	tried	so	hard	to	protect	people	from	.
But	her	dream	of	Coal	River	Mountain	Wind	is	her	legacy	.
And	she	might	not	get	to	see	that	mountaintop	.
But	rather	than	writing	yet	some	kind	of	manifesto	or	something	,	she	's	leaving	behind	a	business	plan	to	make	it	happen	.
That	's	what	my	homegirl	is	doing	.
So	I	'm	so	proud	of	that	.
But	these	three	people	do	n't	know	each	other	,	but	they	do	have	an	awful	lot	in	common	.
They	're	all	problem	solvers	,	and	they	're	just	some	of	the	many	examples	that	I	really	am	privileged	to	see	,	meet	and	learn	from	in	the	examples	of	the	work	that	I	do	now	.
I	was	really	lucky	to	have	them	all	featured	on	my	Corporation	for	Public	Radio	radio	show	called	ThePromisedLand.org	.
Now	they	're	all	very	practical	visionaries	.
They	take	a	look	at	the	demands	that	are	out	there	--	beauty	products	,	healthy	schools	,	electricity	--	and	how	the	money	's	flowing	to	meet	those	demands	.
And	when	the	cheapest	solutions	involve	reducing	the	number	of	jobs	,	you	're	left	with	unemployed	people	,	and	those	people	are	n't	cheap	.
In	fact	,	they	make	up	some	of	what	I	call	the	most	expensive	citizens	,	and	they	include	generationally	impoverished	,	traumatized	vets	returning	from	the	Middle	East	,	people	coming	out	of	jail	.
And	for	the	veterans	in	particular	,	the	V.A	.	said	there	's	a	six-fold	increase	in	mental	health	pharmaceuticals	by	vets	since	2003	.
I	think	that	number	's	probably	going	to	go	up	.
They	're	not	the	largest	number	of	people	,	but	they	are	some	of	the	most	expensive	--	and	in	terms	of	the	likelihood	for	domestic	abuse	,	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	poor	performance	by	their	kids	in	schools	and	also	poor	health	as	a	result	of	stress	.
So	these	three	guys	all	understand	how	to	productively	channel	dollars	through	our	local	economies	to	meet	existing	market	demands	,	reduce	the	social	problems	that	we	have	now	and	prevent	new	problems	in	the	future	.
And	there	are	plenty	of	other	examples	like	that	.
One	problem	:	waste	handling	and	unemployment	.
Even	when	we	think	or	talk	about	recycling	,	lots	of	recyclable	stuff	ends	up	getting	incinerated	or	in	landfills	and	leaving	many	municipalities	,	diversion	rates	--	they	leave	much	to	be	recycled	.
And	where	is	this	waste	handled	?	Usually	in	poor	communities	.
And	we	know	that	eco-industrial	business	,	these	kinds	of	business	models	--	there	's	a	model	in	Europe	called	the	eco-industrial	park	,	where	either	the	waste	of	one	company	is	the	raw	material	for	another	,	or	you	use	recycled	materials	to	make	goods	that	you	can	actually	use	and	sell	.
We	can	create	these	local	markets	and	incentives	for	recycled	materials	to	be	used	as	raw	materials	for	manufacturing	.
And	in	my	hometown	,	we	actually	tried	to	do	one	of	these	in	the	Bronx	,	but	our	mayor	decided	what	he	wanted	to	see	was	a	jail	on	that	same	spot	.
Fortunately	--	because	we	wanted	to	create	hundreds	of	jobs	--	but	after	many	years	,	the	city	wanted	to	build	a	jail	.
They	've	since	abandoned	that	project	,	thank	goodness	.
Another	problem	:	unhealthy	food	systems	and	unemployment	.
Working-class	and	poor	urban	Americans	are	not	benefiting	economically	from	our	current	food	system	.
It	relies	too	much	on	transportation	,	chemical	fertilization	,	big	use	of	water	and	also	refrigeration	.
Mega	agricultural	operations	often	are	responsible	for	poisoning	our	waterways	and	our	land	,	and	it	produces	this	incredibly	unhealthy	product	that	costs	us	billions	in	healthcare	and	lost	productivity	.
And	so	we	know	``	urban	ag	''	is	a	big	buzz	topic	this	time	of	the	year	,	but	it	's	mostly	gardening	,	which	has	some	value	in	community	building	--	lots	of	it	--	but	it	's	not	in	terms	of	creating	jobs	or	for	food	production	.
The	numbers	just	are	n't	there	.
Part	of	my	work	now	is	really	laying	the	groundwork	to	integrate	urban	ag	and	rural	food	systems	to	hasten	the	demise	of	the	3,000-mile	salad	by	creating	a	national	brand	of	urban-grown	produce	in	every	city	,	that	uses	regional	growing	power	and	augments	it	with	indoor	growing	facilities	,	owned	and	operated	by	small	growers	,	where	now	there	are	only	consumers	.
This	can	support	seasonal	farmers	around	metro	areas	who	are	losing	out	because	they	really	ca	n't	meet	the	year-round	demand	for	produce	.
It	's	not	a	competition	with	rural	farm	;	it	's	actually	reinforcements	.
It	allies	in	a	really	positive	and	economically	viable	food	system	.
The	goal	is	to	meet	the	cities	'	institutional	demands	senior	centers	,	schools	,	daycare	centers	,	and	produce	a	network	of	regional	jobs	,	as	well	.
This	is	smart	infrastructure	.
And	how	we	manage	our	built	environment	affects	the	health	and	well-being	of	people	every	single	day	.
Our	municipalities	,	rural	and	urban	,	play	the	operational	course	of	infrastructure	--	things	like	waste	disposal	,	energy	demand	,	as	well	as	social	costs	of	unemployment	,	drop-out	rates	,	incarceration	rates	and	the	impacts	of	various	public	health	costs	.
Smart	infrastructure	can	provide	cost-saving	ways	for	municipalities	to	handle	both	infrastructure	and	social	needs	.
And	we	want	to	shift	the	systems	that	open	the	doors	for	people	who	were	formerly	tax	burdens	to	become	part	of	the	tax	base	.
And	imagine	a	national	business	model	that	creates	local	jobs	and	smart	infrastructure	to	improve	local	economic	stability	.
So	I	'm	hoping	you	can	see	a	little	theme	here	.
These	examples	indicate	a	trend	.
I	have	n't	created	it	,	and	it	's	not	happening	by	accident	.
I	'm	noticing	that	it	's	happening	all	over	the	country	,	and	the	good	news	is	that	it	's	growing	.
And	we	all	need	to	be	invested	in	it	.
It	is	an	essential	pillar	to	this	country	's	recovery	.
And	I	call	it	``	hometown	security	.	''
The	recession	has	us	reeling	and	fearful	,	and	there	's	something	in	the	air	these	days	that	is	also	very	empowering	.
It	's	a	realization	that	we	are	the	key	to	our	own	recovery	.
Now	is	the	time	for	us	to	act	in	our	own	communities	where	we	think	local	and	we	act	local	.
And	when	we	do	that	,	our	neighbors	--	be	they	next-door	,	or	in	the	next	state	,	or	in	the	next	country	--	will	be	just	fine	.
The	sum	of	the	local	is	the	global	.
Hometown	security	means	rebuilding	our	natural	defenses	,	putting	people	to	work	,	restoring	our	natural	systems	.
Hometown	security	means	creating	wealth	here	at	home	,	instead	of	destroying	it	overseas	.
Tackling	social	and	environmental	problems	at	the	same	time	with	the	same	solution	yields	great	cost	savings	,	wealth	generation	and	national	security	.
Many	great	and	inspiring	solutions	have	been	generated	across	America	.
The	challenge	for	us	now	is	to	identify	and	support	countless	more	.
Now	,	hometown	security	is	about	taking	care	of	your	own	,	but	it	's	not	like	the	old	saying	,	``	charity	begins	at	home	.	''
I	recently	read	a	book	called	``	Love	Leadership	''	by	John	Hope	Bryant	.
And	it	's	about	leading	in	a	world	that	really	does	seem	to	be	operating	on	the	basis	of	fear	.
And	reading	that	book	made	me	reexamine	that	theory	because	I	need	to	explain	what	I	mean	by	that	.
See	,	my	dad	was	a	great	,	great	man	in	many	ways	.
He	grew	up	in	the	segregated	South	,	escaped	lynching	and	all	that	during	some	really	hard	times	,	and	he	provided	a	really	stable	home	for	me	and	my	siblings	and	a	whole	bunch	of	other	people	that	fell	on	hard	times	.
But	,	like	all	of	us	,	he	had	some	problems	.
And	his	was	gambling	,	compulsively	.
To	him	that	phrase	,	``	Charity	begins	at	home	,	''	meant	that	my	payday	--	or	someone	else	's	--	would	just	happen	to	coincide	with	his	lucky	day	.
So	you	need	to	help	him	out	.
And	sometimes	I	would	loan	him	money	from	my	after-school	or	summer	jobs	,	and	he	always	had	the	great	intention	of	paying	me	back	with	interest	,	of	course	,	after	he	hit	it	big	.
And	he	did	sometimes	,	believe	it	or	not	,	at	a	racetrack	in	Los	Angeles	--	one	reason	to	love	L.A.	--	back	in	the	1940s	.
He	made	15,000	dollars	cash	and	bought	the	house	that	I	grew	up	in	.
So	I	'm	not	that	unhappy	about	that	.
But	listen	,	I	did	feel	obligated	to	him	,	and	I	grew	up	--	then	I	grew	up	.
And	I	'm	a	grown	woman	now	,	and	I	have	learned	a	few	things	along	the	way	.
often	is	just	about	giving	,	because	you	're	supposed	to	,	or	because	it	's	what	you	've	always	done	,	or	it	's	about	giving	until	it	hurts	.
I	'm	about	providing	the	means	to	build	something	that	will	grow	and	intensify	its	original	investment	and	not	just	require	greater	giving	next	year	--	I	'm	not	trying	to	feed	the	habit	.
I	spent	some	years	watching	how	good	intentions	for	community	empowerment	,	that	were	supposed	to	be	there	to	support	the	community	and	empower	it	,	actually	left	people	in	the	same	,	if	not	worse	,	position	that	they	were	in	before	.
And	over	the	past	20	years	,	we	've	spent	record	amounts	of	philanthropic	dollars	on	social	problems	,	yet	educational	outcomes	,	malnutrition	,	incarceration	,	obesity	,	diabetes	,	income	disparity	,	they	've	all	gone	up	with	some	exceptions	--	in	particular	,	infant	mortality	among	people	in	poverty	--	but	it	's	a	great	world	that	we	're	bringing	them	into	as	well	.
And	I	know	a	little	bit	about	these	issues	,	because	,	for	many	years	,	I	spent	a	long	time	in	the	non-profit	industrial	complex	,	and	I	'm	a	recovering	executive	director	,	two	years	clean	.
But	during	that	time	,	I	realized	that	it	was	about	projects	and	developing	them	on	the	local	level	that	really	was	going	to	do	the	right	thing	for	our	communities	.
But	I	really	did	struggle	for	financial	support	.
The	greater	our	success	,	the	less	money	came	in	from	foundations	.
And	I	tell	you	,	being	on	the	TED	stage	and	winning	a	MacArthur	in	the	same	exact	year	gave	everyone	the	impression	that	I	had	arrived	.
And	by	the	time	I	'd	moved	on	,	I	was	actually	covering	a	third	of	my	agency	's	budget	deficit	with	speaking	fees	.
And	I	think	because	early	on	,	frankly	,	my	programs	were	just	a	little	bit	ahead	of	their	time	.
But	since	then	,	the	park	that	was	just	a	dump	and	was	featured	at	a	TED2006	Talk	became	this	little	thing	.
But	I	did	in	fact	get	married	in	it	.
Over	here	.
There	goes	my	dog	who	led	me	to	the	park	in	my	wedding	.
The	South	Bronx	Greenway	was	also	just	a	drawing	on	the	stage	back	in	2006	.
Since	then	,	we	got	about	50	million	dollars	in	stimulus	package	money	to	come	and	get	here	.
And	we	love	this	,	because	I	love	construction	now	,	because	we	're	watching	these	things	actually	happen	.
So	I	want	everyone	to	understand	the	critical	importance	of	shifting	charity	into	enterprise	.
I	started	my	firm	to	help	communities	across	the	country	realize	their	own	potential	to	improve	everything	about	the	quality	of	life	for	their	people	.
Hometown	security	is	next	on	my	to-do	list	.
What	we	need	are	people	who	see	the	value	in	investing	in	these	types	of	local	enterprises	,	who	will	partner	with	folks	like	me	to	identify	the	growth	trends	and	climate	adaptation	as	well	as	understand	the	growing	social	costs	of	business	as	usual	.
We	need	to	work	together	to	embrace	and	repair	our	land	,	repair	our	power	systems	and	repair	ourselves	.
It	's	time	to	stop	building	the	shopping	malls	,	the	prisons	,	the	stadiums	and	other	tributes	to	all	of	our	collective	failures	.
It	is	time	that	we	start	building	living	monuments	to	hope	and	possibility	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

Bucking	the	trend	to	push	students	toward	increasingly	narrow	areas	of	study	,	she	proposes	a	truly	cross-disciplinary	education	--	one	that	dynamically	combines	all	areas	of	study	to	address	the	great	problems	of	our	day	.

Liz	Coleman	's	call	to	reinvent	liberal	arts	education
College	presidents	are	not	the	first	people	who	come	to	mind	when	the	subject	is	the	uses	of	the	creative	imagination	.
So	I	thought	I	'd	start	by	telling	you	how	I	got	here	.
The	story	begins	in	the	late	'90s	.
I	was	invited	to	meet	with	leading	educators	from	the	newly	free	Eastern	Europe	and	Russia	.
They	were	trying	to	figure	out	how	to	rebuild	their	universities	.
Since	education	under	the	Soviet	Union	was	essentially	propaganda	serving	the	purposes	of	a	state	ideology	,	they	appreciated	that	it	would	take	wholesale	transformations	if	they	were	to	provide	an	education	worthy	of	free	men	and	women	.
Given	this	rare	opportunity	to	start	fresh	,	they	chose	liberal	arts	as	the	most	compelling	model	because	of	its	historic	commitment	to	furthering	its	students	'	broadest	intellectual	,	and	deepest	ethical	potential	.
Having	made	that	decision	they	came	to	the	United	States	,	home	of	liberal	arts	education	,	to	talk	with	some	of	us	most	closely	identified	with	that	kind	of	education	.
They	spoke	with	a	passion	,	an	urgency	,	an	intellectual	conviction	that	,	for	me	,	was	a	voice	I	had	not	heard	in	decades	,	a	dream	long	forgotten	.
For	,	in	truth	,	we	had	moved	light	years	from	the	passions	that	animated	them	.
But	for	me	,	unlike	them	,	in	my	world	,	the	slate	was	not	clean	,	and	what	was	written	on	it	was	not	encouraging	.
In	truth	,	liberal	arts	education	no	longer	exists	--	at	least	genuine	liberal	arts	education	--	in	this	country	.
We	have	professionalized	liberal	arts	to	the	point	where	they	no	longer	provide	the	breadth	of	application	and	the	enhanced	capacity	for	civic	engagement	that	is	their	signature	.
Over	the	past	century	the	expert	has	dethroned	the	educated	generalist	to	become	the	sole	model	of	intellectual	accomplishment	.
Expertise	has	for	sure	had	its	moments	.
But	the	price	of	its	dominance	is	enormous	.
Subject	matters	are	broken	up	into	smaller	and	smaller	pieces	,	with	increasing	emphasis	on	the	technical	and	the	obscure	.
We	have	even	managed	to	make	the	study	of	literature	arcane	.
You	may	think	you	know	what	is	going	on	in	that	Jane	Austen	novel	--	that	is	,	until	your	first	encounter	with	postmodern	deconstructionism	.
The	progression	of	today	's	college	student	is	to	jettison	every	interest	except	one	.
And	within	that	one	,	to	continually	narrow	the	focus	,	learning	more	and	more	about	less	and	less	;	this	,	despite	the	evidence	all	around	us	of	the	interconnectedness	of	things	.
Lest	you	think	I	exaggerate	,	here	are	the	beginnings	of	the	A-B-Cs	of	anthropology	.
As	one	moves	up	the	ladder	,	values	other	than	technical	competence	are	viewed	with	increasing	suspicion	.
Questions	such	as	,	``	What	kind	of	a	world	are	we	making	?
What	kind	of	a	world	should	we	be	making	?
What	kind	of	a	world	can	we	be	making	?	''
are	treated	with	more	and	more	skepticism	,	and	move	off	the	table	.
In	so	doing	,	the	guardians	of	secular	democracy	in	effect	yield	the	connection	between	education	and	values	who	,	you	can	be	sure	,	have	no	compunctions	about	using	education	to	further	their	values	:	the	absolutes	of	a	theocracy	.
Meanwhile	,	the	values	and	voices	of	democracy	are	silent	.
Either	we	have	lost	touch	with	those	values	or	,	no	better	,	believe	they	need	not	or	can	not	be	taught	.
This	aversion	to	social	values	may	seem	at	odds	with	the	explosion	of	community	service	programs	.
But	despite	the	attention	paid	to	these	efforts	,	they	remain	emphatically	extracurricular	.
In	effect	,	civic-mindedness	is	treated	as	outside	the	realm	of	what	purports	to	be	serious	thinking	and	adult	purposes	.
Simply	put	,	when	the	impulse	is	to	change	the	world	,	the	academy	is	more	likely	to	engender	a	learned	helplessness	than	to	create	a	sense	of	empowerment	.
This	brew	--	oversimplification	of	civic	engagement	,	idealization	of	the	expert	,	fragmentation	of	knowledge	,	emphasis	on	technical	mastery	,	neutrality	as	a	condition	of	academic	integrity	--	is	toxic	when	it	comes	to	pursuing	the	vital	connections	between	education	and	the	public	good	,	between	intellectual	integrity	and	human	freedom	,	which	were	at	the	heart	--	--	of	the	challenge	posed	to	and	by	my	European	colleagues	.
When	the	astronomical	distance	between	the	realities	of	the	academy	and	the	visionary	intensity	of	this	challenge	were	more	than	enough	,	I	can	assure	you	,	to	give	one	pause	,	what	was	happening	outside	higher	education	Whether	it	was	threats	to	the	environment	,	inequities	in	the	distribution	of	wealth	,	lack	of	a	sane	policy	or	a	sustainable	policy	with	respect	to	the	continuing	uses	of	energy	,	we	were	in	desperate	straits	.
And	that	was	only	the	beginning	.
The	corrupting	of	our	political	life	had	become	a	living	nightmare	;	nothing	was	exempt	--	separation	of	powers	,	civil	liberties	,	the	rule	of	law	,	the	relationship	of	church	and	state	.
Accompanied	by	a	squandering	of	the	nation	's	material	wealth	that	defied	credulity	.
A	harrowing	predilection	for	the	uses	of	force	had	become	commonplace	,	with	an	equal	distaste	for	the	alternative	forms	of	influence	.
At	the	same	time	,	all	of	our	firepower	was	impotent	when	it	came	to	halting	or	even	stemming	the	slaughter	in	Rwanda	,	Darfur	,	Myanmar	.
Our	public	education	,	once	a	model	for	the	world	,	has	become	most	noteworthy	for	its	failures	.
Mastery	of	basic	skills	and	a	bare	minimum	of	cultural	literacy	eludes	vast	numbers	of	our	students	.
Despite	having	a	research	establishment	that	is	the	envy	of	the	world	,	more	than	half	of	the	American	public	do	n't	believe	in	evolution	.
And	do	n't	press	your	luck	about	how	much	those	who	do	believe	in	it	actually	understand	it	.
Incredibly	,	this	nation	,	with	all	its	material	,	intellectual	and	spiritual	resources	,	to	reverse	the	freefall	in	any	of	these	areas	.
Equally	startling	,	from	my	point	of	view	,	is	the	fact	that	no	one	was	drawing	any	connections	between	what	is	happening	to	the	body	politic	,	and	what	is	happening	in	our	leading	educational	institutions	.
We	may	be	at	the	top	of	the	list	when	it	comes	to	influencing	access	to	personal	wealth	.
We	are	not	even	on	the	list	when	it	comes	to	our	responsibility	for	the	health	of	this	democracy	.
We	are	playing	with	fire	.
You	can	be	sure	Jefferson	knew	what	he	was	talking	about	when	he	said	,	``	If	a	nation	expects	to	be	ignorant	and	free	in	a	state	of	civilization	,	it	expects	what	never	was	,	and	never	will	be	.	''
On	a	more	personal	note	,	this	betrayal	of	our	principles	,	our	decency	,	our	hope	,	made	it	impossible	for	me	to	avoid	the	question	,	``	What	will	I	say	,	years	from	now	,	when	people	ask	,	'Where	were	you	?	'	''	As	president	of	a	leading	liberal	arts	college	,	famous	for	its	innovative	history	,	there	were	no	excuses	.
So	the	conversation	began	at	Bennington	.
Knowing	that	if	we	were	to	regain	the	integrity	of	liberal	education	,	it	would	take	radical	rethinking	of	basic	assumptions	,	beginning	with	our	priorities	.
Enhancing	the	public	good	becomes	a	primary	objective	.
The	accomplishment	of	civic	virtue	is	tied	to	the	uses	of	intellect	and	imagination	at	their	most	challenging	.
Our	ways	of	approaching	agency	and	authority	turn	inside	out	to	reflect	the	reality	that	no	one	has	the	answers	to	the	challenges	facing	citizens	in	this	century	,	and	everyone	has	the	responsibility	for	trying	and	participating	in	finding	them	.
Bennington	would	continue	to	teach	the	arts	and	sciences	as	areas	of	immersion	that	acknowledge	differences	in	personal	and	professional	objectives	.
But	the	balances	redressed	,	our	shared	purposes	assume	an	equal	When	the	design	emerged	it	was	surprisingly	simple	and	straightforward	.
The	idea	is	to	make	the	political-social	challenges	themselves	--	from	health	and	education	to	the	uses	of	force	--	the	organizers	of	the	curriculum	.
They	would	assume	the	commanding	role	of	traditional	disciplines	.
But	structures	designed	to	connect	,	rather	than	divide	mutually	dependent	circles	,	rather	than	isolating	triangles	.
And	the	point	is	not	to	treat	these	topics	as	topics	of	study	,	but	as	frameworks	of	action	.
The	challenge	:	to	figure	out	what	it	will	take	to	actually	do	something	that	makes	a	significant	and	sustainable	difference	.
Contrary	to	widely	held	assumptions	,	an	emphasis	on	action	provides	a	special	urgency	to	thinking	.
The	importance	of	coming	to	grips	with	values	like	justice	,	equity	,	truth	,	becomes	increasingly	evident	as	students	discover	that	interest	alone	can	not	tell	them	what	they	need	to	know	when	the	issue	is	rethinking	education	,	our	approach	to	health	,	or	strategies	for	achieving	an	economics	of	equity	.
The	value	of	the	past	also	comes	alive	;	it	provides	a	lot	of	company	.
You	are	not	the	first	to	try	to	figure	this	out	,	just	as	you	are	unlikely	to	be	the	last	.
Even	more	valuable	,	history	provides	a	laboratory	in	which	we	see	played	out	the	actual	,	as	well	as	the	intended	consequences	of	ideas	.
In	the	language	of	my	students	,	``	Deep	thought	matters	when	you	're	contemplating	what	to	do	about	things	that	matter	.	''
A	new	liberal	arts	that	can	support	this	action-oriented	curriculum	has	begun	to	emerge	.
Rhetoric	,	the	art	of	organizing	the	world	of	words	to	maximum	effect	.
Design	,	the	art	of	organizing	the	world	of	things	.
Mediation	and	improvisation	also	assume	a	special	place	in	this	new	pantheon	.
Quantitative	reasoning	attains	its	proper	position	at	the	heart	of	what	it	takes	to	manage	change	where	measurement	is	crucial	.
As	is	a	capacity	to	discriminate	systematically	between	what	is	at	the	core	and	what	is	at	the	periphery	.
And	when	making	connections	is	of	the	essence	,	the	power	of	technology	emerges	with	special	intensity	.
But	so	does	the	importance	of	content	.
The	more	powerful	our	reach	,	the	more	important	the	question	``	About	what	?	''
When	improvisation	,	resourcefulness	,	imagination	are	key	,	artists	,	at	long	last	,	take	their	place	at	the	table	,	when	strategies	of	action	are	in	the	process	of	being	designed	.
In	this	dramatically	expanded	ideal	of	a	liberal	arts	education	where	the	continuum	of	thought	and	action	is	its	life	's	blood	,	knowledge	honed	outside	the	academy	becomes	essential	.
Social	activists	,	business	leaders	,	lawyers	,	politicians	,	professionals	will	join	the	faculty	as	active	and	ongoing	participants	in	this	wedding	of	liberal	education	to	the	advancement	of	the	public	good	.
Students	,	in	turn	,	continuously	move	outside	the	classroom	to	engage	the	world	directly	.
And	of	course	,	this	new	wine	needs	new	bottles	if	we	are	to	capture	the	liveliness	and	dynamism	of	this	idea	.
The	most	important	discovery	we	made	in	our	focus	on	public	action	was	to	appreciate	that	the	hard	choices	are	not	between	good	and	evil	,	but	between	competing	goods	.
This	discovery	is	transforming	.
It	undercuts	self-righteousness	,	radically	alters	the	tone	and	character	of	controversy	,	and	enriches	dramatically	the	possibilities	for	finding	common	ground	.
Ideology	,	zealotry	,	unsubstantiated	opinions	simply	wo	n't	do	.
This	is	a	political	education	,	to	be	sure	.
But	it	is	a	politics	of	principle	,	not	of	partisanship	.
So	the	challenge	for	Bennington	is	to	do	it	.
On	the	cover	of	Bennington	's	2008	holiday	card	is	the	architect	's	sketch	of	a	building	opening	in	2010	that	is	to	be	a	center	for	the	advancement	of	public	action	.
The	center	will	embody	and	sustain	this	new	educational	commitment	.
Think	of	it	as	a	kind	of	secular	church	.
The	words	on	the	card	describe	what	will	happen	inside	.
We	intend	to	turn	the	intellectual	and	imaginative	power	,	passion	and	boldness	of	our	students	,	faculty	and	staff	to	developing	strategies	for	acting	on	the	critical	challenges	of	our	time	.
So	we	are	doing	our	job	.
While	these	past	weeks	have	been	a	time	of	national	exhilaration	in	this	country	,	it	would	be	tragic	if	you	thought	this	meant	your	job	was	done	.
The	glacial	silence	we	have	experienced	in	the	face	of	the	shredding	of	the	constitution	,	the	unraveling	of	our	public	institutions	,	the	deterioration	of	our	infrastructure	is	not	limited	to	the	universities	.
We	the	people	have	become	inured	to	our	own	irrelevance	when	it	comes	to	doing	anything	significant	about	anything	that	matters	concerning	governance	,	beyond	waiting	another	four	years	.
We	persist	also	in	being	sidelined	by	the	idea	of	the	expert	as	the	only	one	capable	of	coming	up	with	answers	,	despite	the	overwhelming	evidence	to	the	contrary	.
The	problem	is	there	is	no	such	thing	as	a	viable	democracy	made	up	of	experts	,	zealots	,	politicians	and	spectators	.
People	will	continue	and	should	continue	to	learn	everything	there	is	to	know	about	something	or	other	.
We	actually	do	it	all	the	time	.
And	there	will	be	and	should	be	those	who	spend	a	lifetime	pursuing	a	very	highly	defined	area	of	inquiry	.
But	this	single-mindedness	will	not	yield	the	flexibilities	of	mind	,	the	multiplicity	of	perspectives	,	the	capacities	for	collaboration	and	innovation	this	country	needs	.
That	is	where	you	come	in	.
What	is	certain	is	that	the	individual	talent	exhibited	in	such	abundance	here	,	needs	to	turn	its	attention	to	that	collaborative	,	messy	,	frustrating	,	contentious	and	impossible	world	of	politics	and	public	policy	.
President	Obama	and	his	team	simply	can	not	do	it	alone	.
If	the	question	of	where	to	start	seems	overwhelming	you	are	at	the	beginning	,	not	the	end	of	this	adventure	.
Being	overwhelmed	is	the	first	step	if	you	are	serious	about	trying	to	get	at	things	that	really	matter	,	on	a	scale	that	makes	a	difference	.
So	what	do	you	do	when	you	feel	overwhelmed	?
Well	,	you	have	two	things	.
You	have	a	mind	.	And	you	have	other	people	.
Start	with	those	,	and	change	the	world	.

At	TEDxNYED	,	former	``	young	Republican	''	Larry	Lessig	talks	about	what	Democrats	can	learn	about	copyright	from	their	opposite	party	,	considered	more	conservative	.	A	surprising	lens	on	remix	culture	.

Lawrence	Lessig	:	Re-examining	the	remix
I	want	to	talk	about	what	we	learn	from	conservatives	.
And	I	'm	at	a	stage	in	life	where	I	'm	yearning	for	my	old	days	,	so	I	want	to	confess	to	you	that	when	I	was	a	kid	,	indeed	,	I	was	a	conservative	.
I	was	a	Young	Republican	,	a	Teenage	Republican	,	a	leader	in	the	Teenage	Republicans	.
Indeed	,	I	was	the	youngest	member	of	any	delegation	in	the	1980	convention	that	elected	Ronald	Reagan	to	be	the	Republican	nominee	for	president	.
Now	,	I	know	what	you	're	thinking	.
You	're	thinking	,	``	That	's	not	what	the	Internets	say	.	''
You	're	thinking	,	``	Wikipedia	does	n't	say	this	fact	.	''
And	indeed	,	this	is	just	one	of	the	examples	of	the	junk	that	flows	across	the	tubes	in	these	Internets	here	.
Wikipedia	reports	that	this	guy	,	this	former	congressman	from	Erie	,	Pennsylvania	was	,	at	the	age	of	20	,	one	of	the	youngest	people	at	the	Republican	National	Convention	,	but	it	's	just	not	true	.
Indeed	,	it	drives	me	so	nuts	,	let	me	just	change	this	little	fact	here	.
All	right	.	Okay	,	so	...	perfect	.
Perfect	.
Okay	,	speaker	Lawrence	Lessig	,	right	.
Okay	.
Finally	,	truth	will	be	brought	here	.
Okay	,	see	?	It	's	done	.	It	's	almost	done	.	Here	we	go	.
``	...	Youngest	Republican	,	''	okay	,	we	're	finished	.
That	's	it	.	Please	save	this	.
Great	,	here	we	go	.
And	...	Wikipedia	is	fixed	,	finally	.
Okay	,	but	no	,	this	is	really	besides	the	point	.
But	the	thing	I	want	you	to	think	about	when	we	think	about	conservatives	--	not	so	much	this	issue	of	the	1980	convention	--	the	thing	to	think	about	is	this	:	They	go	to	church	.
Now	,	you	know	,	I	mean	,	a	lot	of	people	go	to	church	.
I	'm	not	talking	about	that	only	conservatives	go	to	church	.
And	I	'm	not	talking	about	the	God	thing	.
I	do	n't	want	to	get	into	that	,	you	know	;	that	's	not	my	point	.
They	go	to	church	,	by	which	I	mean	,	they	do	lots	of	things	for	free	for	each	other	.
They	hold	potluck	dinners	.
Indeed	,	they	sell	books	about	potluck	dinners	.
They	serve	food	to	poor	people	.
They	share	,	they	give	,	they	give	away	for	free	.
And	it	's	the	very	same	people	leading	Wall	Street	firms	who	,	on	Sundays	,	show	up	and	share	.
And	not	only	food	,	right	.
These	very	same	people	are	strong	believers	,	in	lots	of	contexts	,	in	the	limits	on	the	markets	.
They	are	in	many	important	places	against	markets	.
Indeed	,	they	,	like	all	of	us	,	celebrate	this	kind	of	relationship	.
But	they	're	very	keen	that	we	do	n't	let	money	drop	into	that	relationship	,	else	it	turns	into	something	like	this	.
They	want	to	regulate	us	,	those	conservatives	,	to	stop	us	from	allowing	the	market	to	spread	in	those	places	.
Because	they	understand	:	There	are	places	for	the	market	and	places	where	the	market	should	not	exist	,	where	we	should	be	free	to	enjoy	the	fellowship	of	others	.
They	recognize	:	Both	of	these	things	have	to	live	together	.
And	the	second	great	thing	about	conservatives	:	they	get	ecology	.
Right	,	it	was	the	first	great	Republican	president	of	the	20th	century	who	taught	us	about	environmental	thinking	--	Teddy	Roosevelt	.
They	first	taught	us	about	ecology	in	the	context	of	natural	resources	.
And	then	they	began	to	teach	us	in	the	context	of	They	understand	,	in	that	context	,	``	free	.	''	They	understand	``	free	''	is	an	important	essential	part	of	the	cultural	ecology	as	well	.
That	's	the	thing	I	want	you	to	think	about	them	.
Now	,	I	know	you	do	n't	believe	me	,	really	,	here	.
So	here	's	exhibit	number	one	.
I	want	to	share	with	you	my	latest	hero	,	Julian	Sanchez	,	a	libertarian	who	works	at	the	,	for	many	people	,	``	evil	''	Cato	Institute	.
Okay	,	so	Julian	made	this	video	.
He	's	a	terrible	producer	of	videos	,	but	it	's	great	content	,	so	I	'm	going	to	give	you	a	little	bit	of	it	.
So	here	he	is	beginning	.
Julian	Sanchez	:	I	'm	going	to	make	an	observation	about	the	way	remix	culture	seems	to	be	evolving	...
Larry	Lessig	:	So	what	he	does	is	he	begins	to	tell	us	about	these	three	videos	.
This	is	this	fantastic	Brat	Pack	remix	set	to	Lisztomania	.
Which	,	of	course	,	spread	virally	.
Hugely	successful	.
And	then	some	people	from	Brooklyn	saw	it	.
They	decided	they	wanted	to	do	the	same	.
And	then	,	of	course	,	people	from	San	Fransisco	saw	it	.
And	San	Franciscans	thought	they	had	to	do	the	same	as	well	.
And	so	they	're	beautiful	,	but	this	libertarian	has	some	important	lessons	he	wants	us	to	learn	from	this	.
Here	's	lesson	number	one	.
JS	:	There	's	obviously	also	something	really	deeply	great	about	this	.
They	are	acting	in	the	sense	that	they	're	emulating	the	original	mashup	.
And	the	guy	who	shot	it	obviously	has	a	strong	eye	and	some	experience	with	video	editing	.
But	this	is	also	basically	just	a	group	of	friends	having	an	authentic	social	moment	and	screwing	around	together	.
It	should	feel	familiar	and	kind	of	resonate	for	anyone	who	's	had	a	sing-a-long	or	a	dance	party	with	a	group	of	good	friends	.
LL	:	Or	...
JS	:	So	that	's	importantly	different	from	the	earlier	videos	we	looked	at	because	here	,	remix	is	n't	just	about	an	individual	doing	something	alone	in	his	basement	;	it	becomes	an	act	of	social	creativity	.
And	it	's	not	just	that	it	yields	a	different	kind	of	product	at	the	end	,	it	's	that	potentially	it	changes	the	way	that	we	relate	to	each	other	.
All	of	our	normal	social	interactions	become	a	kind	of	invitation	to	this	sort	of	collective	expression	.
It	's	our	real	social	lives	themselves	that	are	transmuted	into	art	.
LL	:	And	so	then	,	what	this	libertarian	draws	from	these	two	points	...
JS	:	One	remix	is	about	individuals	using	our	shared	culture	as	a	kind	of	language	to	communicate	something	to	an	audience	.
Stage	two	,	social	remix	,	is	really	about	using	it	to	mediate	people	's	relationships	to	each	other	.
First	,	within	each	video	,	the	Brat	Pack	characters	are	used	as	a	kind	of	template	for	performing	the	social	reality	of	each	group	.
But	there	's	also	a	dialogue	between	the	videos	,	where	,	once	the	basic	structure	is	established	,	it	becomes	a	kind	of	platform	for	articulating	the	similarities	and	differences	between	the	groups	'	social	and	physical	worlds	.
LL	:	And	then	,	here	's	for	me	,	the	critical	key	to	what	Julian	has	to	say	...
JS	:	Copyright	policy	is	n't	just	about	how	to	incentivize	the	production	of	a	certain	kind	of	artistic	commodity	;	it	's	about	what	level	of	control	we	're	going	to	permit	to	be	exercised	over	our	social	realities	--	social	realities	that	are	now	inevitably	permeated	by	pop	culture	.
I	think	it	's	important	that	we	keep	these	two	different	kinds	of	public	goods	in	mind	.
If	we	're	only	focused	on	how	to	maximize	the	supply	of	one	,	I	think	we	risk	suppressing	this	different	and	richer	and	,	in	some	ways	,	maybe	even	more	important	one	.
LL	:	Right	.	Bingo	.	Point	.
Freedom	needs	this	opportunity	to	both	have	the	commercial	success	of	the	great	commercial	works	and	the	opportunity	to	build	this	different	kind	of	culture	.
And	for	that	to	happen	,	you	need	ideas	like	fair	use	to	be	central	and	protected	,	to	enable	this	kind	of	innovation	,	as	this	libertarian	tells	us	,	between	these	two	creative	cultures	,	a	commercial	and	a	sharing	culture	.
The	point	is	they	,	he	,	here	,	gets	that	culture	.
Now	,	my	concern	is	,	we	Dems	,	too	often	,	not	so	much	.
All	right	,	take	for	example	this	great	company	.
In	the	good	old	days	when	this	Republican	ran	that	company	,	their	greatest	work	was	work	that	built	on	the	past	,	right	.
All	of	the	great	Disney	works	were	works	that	took	works	that	were	in	the	public	domain	and	remixed	them	,	or	waited	until	they	entered	the	public	domain	to	remix	them	,	to	celebrate	this	add-on	remix	creativity	.
Indeed	,	Mickey	Mouse	himself	,	of	course	,	as	``	Steamboat	Willie	,	''	is	a	remix	of	the	then	,	very	dominant	,	very	popular	``	Steamboat	Bill	''	by	Buster	Keaton	.
This	man	was	a	remixer	extraordinaire	.
He	is	the	celebration	and	ideal	of	exactly	this	kind	of	creativity	.
But	then	the	company	passes	through	this	dark	stage	to	this	Democrat	.
Wildly	different	.
This	is	the	mastermind	behind	the	eventual	passage	of	what	we	call	the	Sonny	Bono	Copyright	Term	Extension	Act	,	extending	the	term	of	existing	copyrights	by	20	years	,	so	that	no	one	could	do	to	Disney	what	Disney	did	to	the	Brothers	Grimm	.
Now	,	when	we	tried	to	challenge	this	,	going	to	the	Supreme	Court	,	getting	the	Supreme	Court	,	the	bunch	of	conservatives	there	--	if	we	could	get	them	to	wake	up	to	this	--	to	strike	it	down	,	we	had	the	assistance	of	Nobel	Prize	winners	including	this	right-wing	Nobel	Prize	winner	,	Milton	Friedman	,	who	said	he	would	join	our	brief	only	if	the	word	``	no	brainer	''	was	in	the	brief	somewhere	.
But	apparently	,	no	brains	existed	in	this	place	when	Democrats	passed	and	signed	this	bill	into	law	.
Now	,	tiny	little	quibble	of	a	footnote	:	Sonny	Bono	,	you	might	say	,	was	a	Republican	,	but	I	do	n't	buy	it	.
This	guy	is	no	Republican	.
Okay	,	for	a	second	example	,	think	about	this	cultural	hero	,	icon	on	the	Left	,	creator	of	this	character	.
Look	at	the	site	that	he	built	:	``	Star	Wars	''	MashUps	,	inviting	people	to	come	and	use	their	creative	energy	to	produce	a	new	generation	of	attention	towards	this	extraordinarily	important	cultural	icon	.
Read	the	license	.
The	license	for	these	remixers	assigns	all	of	the	rights	to	the	remix	back	to	Lucas	.
The	mashup	is	owned	by	Lucas	.
Indeed	,	anything	you	add	to	the	mashup	,	music	you	might	add	,	Lucas	has	a	worldwide	perpetual	right	to	exploit	that	for	free	.
There	is	no	creator	here	to	be	recognized	.
The	creator	does	n't	have	any	rights	.
The	creator	is	a	sharecropper	in	this	story	.
And	we	should	remember	who	employed	the	sharecroppers	:	the	Democrats	,	right	?
So	the	point	is	the	Republicans	here	recognize	that	there	's	a	certain	need	of	ownership	,	a	respect	for	ownership	,	the	respect	we	should	give	the	creator	,	the	remixer	,	the	owner	,	the	property	owner	,	the	copyright	owner	of	this	extraordinarily	powerful	stuff	,	and	not	a	generation	of	sharecroppers	.
Now	,	I	think	there	are	lessons	we	should	learn	here	,	lessons	about	openness	.
Our	lives	are	sharing	activities	,	at	least	in	part	.
Even	for	the	head	of	Goldman	Sachs	,	at	least	in	part	.
And	for	that	sharing	activity	to	happen	,	we	have	to	have	well-protected	spaces	of	fair	use	.
That	's	number	one	.	Number	two	:	This	ecology	of	sharing	needs	freedom	within	which	to	create	.
Freedom	,	which	means	without	permission	from	anyone	,	the	ability	to	create	.
And	number	three	:	We	need	to	respect	the	creator	,	the	creator	of	these	remixes	through	rights	that	are	directly	tied	to	them	.
Now	,	this	explains	the	right-wing	nonprofit	Creative	Commons	.
Actually	,	it	's	not	a	right-wing	nonprofit	,	but	of	course	--	let	me	just	tie	it	here	--	the	Creative	Commons	,	which	is	offering	authors	this	simple	way	to	mark	their	content	with	the	freedoms	they	intended	to	carry	.
So	that	we	go	from	a	``	all	rights	reserved	''	world	to	a	``	some	rights	reserved	''	world	so	that	people	can	know	the	freedoms	they	have	attached	to	the	content	,	building	and	creating	on	the	basis	of	this	creative	copyrighted	work	.
These	tools	that	we	built	enable	this	sharing	in	parts	through	licenses	that	make	it	clear	and	a	freedom	to	create	without	requiring	permission	first	because	the	permission	has	already	been	granted	and	a	respect	for	the	creator	because	it	builds	upon	a	copyright	the	creator	has	licensed	freely	.
And	it	explains	the	vast	right-wing	conspiracy	that	's	obviously	developed	around	these	licenses	,	as	now	more	than	350	million	digital	objects	are	out	there	,	licensed	freely	in	this	way	.
Now	that	picture	of	an	ecology	of	creativity	,	the	picture	of	an	ecology	of	balanced	creativity	,	is	that	the	ecology	of	creativity	we	have	right	now	?
Well	,	as	you	all	know	,	not	many	of	us	believe	we	do	.
I	tripped	on	the	reality	of	this	ecology	of	creativity	just	last	week	.
I	created	a	video	which	was	based	on	a	Wireside	Chat	that	I	'd	given	,	and	I	uploaded	it	to	YouTube	.
I	then	got	this	email	from	YouTube	weirdly	notifying	me	that	there	was	content	in	that	owned	by	the	mysterious	WMG	that	matched	their	content	ID	.
So	I	did	n't	think	much	about	it	.
And	then	on	Twitter	,	somebody	said	to	me	,	``	Your	talk	on	YouTube	was	DMCA	'd	.	Was	that	your	purpose	?	''
imagining	that	I	had	this	deep	conspiracy	to	reveal	the	obvious	flaws	in	the	DMCA	.
I	answered	,	``	No	.	''	I	did	n't	even	think	about	it	.
But	then	I	went	to	the	site	and	all	of	the	audio	in	my	site	had	been	silenced	.
My	whole	45-minute	video	had	been	silenced	because	there	were	snippets	in	that	video	,	a	video	about	fair	use	,	that	included	Warner	Music	Group	music	.
Now	,	interestingly	,	they	still	sold	ads	for	that	music	,	if	you	played	the	silent	video	.
You	could	still	buy	the	music	,	but	you	could	n't	hear	anything	because	it	had	been	silenced	.
So	I	did	what	the	current	regime	says	I	must	do	to	be	free	to	use	YouTube	to	talk	about	fair	use	.
I	went	to	this	site	,	and	I	had	to	answer	these	questions	.
And	then	in	an	extraordinarily	Bart	Simpson-like	,	juvenile	way	you	've	actually	got	to	type	out	these	words	and	get	them	right	to	reassert	your	freedom	to	speak	.
And	I	felt	like	I	was	in	third	grade	again	.
``	I	will	not	put	tacks	on	the	teacher	's	chair	.
I	will	not	put	tacks	on	the	teacher	's	chair	.	''
This	is	absurd	.
It	is	outrageous	.
It	is	an	extraordinary	perversion	of	the	system	of	freedom	we	should	be	encouraging	.
And	the	question	I	ask	you	is	:	Who	's	fighting	it	?
Well	,	interestingly	,	in	the	last	presidential	election	,	who	was	the	number	one	,	active	opponent	of	this	system	of	regulation	in	online	speech	?
John	McCain	.
Letter	after	letter	attacking	YouTube	's	refusal	to	be	more	respectful	of	fair	use	with	their	extraordinary	notice	and	take	down	system	,	that	led	his	campaign	so	many	times	to	be	thrown	off	the	Internet	.
Now	,	that	was	the	story	of	me	then	,	my	good	old	days	of	right-wing	lunacy	.
Let	me	come	back	to	now	,	now	when	I	'm	a	little	leftist	--	I	'm	certainly	left-handed	,	so	at	least	a	lefty	--	And	I	wonder	,	can	we	on	the	Left	expect	to	build	this	ecology	of	freedom	,	now	,	in	a	world	where	we	know	the	extraordinarily	powerful	influences	against	it	,	where	even	icons	of	the	Left	like	this	entertain	and	push	bills	that	would	effectively	ban	the	requirement	of	open	access	for	government-funded	research	?
The	president	,	who	has	supported	a	process	that	secretly	negotiates	agreements	,	which	effectively	lock	us	into	the	insane	system	of	DMCA	that	we	have	adopted	and	likely	lock	us	down	a	path	of	three	strikes	,	you	're	out	that	,	of	course	,	the	rest	of	the	world	are	increasingly	adopting	.
Not	a	single	example	of	reform	has	been	produced	yet	.
And	we	're	not	going	to	see	this	change	in	this	system	anytime	soon	.
So	here	's	the	lessons	of	openness	that	I	think	we	need	to	learn	.
Openness	is	a	commitment	to	a	certain	set	of	values	.
We	need	to	speak	of	those	values	.
The	value	of	freedom	.	It	's	a	value	of	community	.
It	's	a	value	of	the	limits	in	regulation	.
It	's	a	value	respecting	the	creator	.
Now	,	if	we	can	learn	those	values	from	at	least	some	influences	on	the	Right	,	if	we	can	take	them	and	incorporate	them	,	maybe	we	could	do	a	little	trade	.
We	learn	those	values	on	the	Left	,	and	maybe	they	'll	do	health	care	or	global	warming	legislation	or	something	in	the	Right	.
Anyway	,	please	join	me	in	teaching	these	values	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

Britta	Riley	wanted	to	grow	her	own	food	.	So	she	and	her	friends	developed	a	system	for	growing	plants	in	discarded	plastic	bottles	--	researching	,	testing	and	tweaking	the	system	using	social	media	,	trying	many	variations	at	once	and	quickly	arriving	at	the	optimal	system	.	Call	it	distributed	DIY	.	And	the	results	?	Delicious	.

Britta	Riley	:	A	garden	in	my	apartment
I	,	like	many	of	you	,	am	one	of	the	two	billion	people	on	Earth	who	live	in	cities	.
And	there	are	days	--	I	do	n't	know	about	the	rest	of	you	guys	--	but	there	are	days	when	I	palpably	feel	how	much	I	rely	on	other	people	for	pretty	much	everything	in	my	life	.
And	some	days	,	that	can	even	be	a	little	scary	.
But	what	I	'm	here	to	talk	to	you	about	today	is	how	that	same	interdependence	is	actually	an	extremely	powerful	social	infrastructure	that	we	can	actually	harness	to	help	heal	some	of	our	deepest	civic	issues	,	if	we	apply	open	source	collaboration	.
A	couple	of	years	ago	,	I	read	an	article	by	New	York	Times	writer	Michael	Pollan	in	which	he	argued	that	growing	even	some	of	our	own	food	is	one	of	the	best	things	that	we	can	do	for	the	environment	.
Now	at	the	time	that	I	was	reading	this	,	it	was	the	middle	of	the	winter	and	I	definitely	did	not	have	room	for	a	lot	of	dirt	in	my	New	York	City	apartment	.
So	I	was	basically	just	willing	to	settle	for	just	reading	the	next	Wired	magazine	and	finding	out	how	the	experts	were	going	to	figure	out	how	to	solve	all	these	problems	for	us	in	the	future	.
But	that	was	actually	exactly	the	point	that	Michael	Pollan	was	making	in	this	article	--	was	it	's	precisely	when	we	hand	over	the	responsibility	for	all	these	things	to	specialists	that	we	cause	the	kind	of	messes	that	we	see	with	the	food	system	.
So	,	I	happen	to	know	a	little	bit	from	my	own	work	about	how	NASA	has	been	using	hydroponics	to	explore	growing	food	in	space	.
And	you	can	actually	get	optimal	nutritional	yield	by	running	a	kind	of	high-quality	liquid	soil	over	plants	'	root	systems	.
Now	to	a	vegetable	plant	,	my	apartment	has	got	to	be	about	as	foreign	as	outer	space	.
But	I	can	offer	some	natural	light	and	year-round	climate	control	.
Fast-forward	two	years	later	:	we	now	have	window	farms	,	which	are	vertical	,	hydroponic	platforms	for	food-growing	indoors	.
And	the	way	it	works	is	that	there	's	a	pump	at	the	bottom	,	which	periodically	sends	some	of	this	liquid	nutrient	solution	up	to	the	top	,	which	then	trickles	down	through	plants	'	root	systems	that	are	suspended	in	clay	pellets	--	so	there	's	no	dirt	involved	.
Now	light	and	temperature	vary	with	each	window	's	microclimate	,	so	a	window	farm	requires	a	farmer	,	and	she	must	decide	what	kind	of	crops	she	is	going	to	put	in	her	window	farm	,	and	whether	she	is	going	to	feed	her	food	organically	.
Back	at	the	time	,	a	window	farm	was	no	more	than	a	technically	complex	idea	that	was	going	to	require	a	lot	of	testing	.
And	I	really	wanted	it	to	be	an	open	project	,	because	hydroponics	is	one	of	the	fastest	growing	areas	of	patenting	in	the	United	States	right	now	and	could	possibly	become	another	area	like	Monsanto	,	where	we	have	a	lot	of	corporate	intellectual	property	in	the	way	of	people	's	food	.
So	I	decided	that	,	instead	of	creating	a	product	,	what	I	was	going	to	do	was	open	this	up	to	a	whole	bunch	of	co-developers	.
The	first	few	systems	that	we	created	,	they	kind	of	worked	.
We	were	actually	able	to	grow	about	a	salad	a	week	in	a	typical	New	York	City	apartment	window	.
And	we	were	able	to	grow	cherry	tomatoes	and	cucumbers	,	all	kinds	of	stuff	.
But	the	first	few	systems	were	these	leaky	,	loud	power-guzzlers	that	Martha	Stewart	would	definitely	never	have	approved	.
So	to	bring	on	more	co-developers	,	what	we	did	was	we	created	a	social	media	site	on	which	we	published	the	designs	,	we	explained	how	they	worked	,	and	we	even	went	so	far	as	to	point	out	everything	that	was	wrong	with	these	systems	.
And	then	we	invited	people	all	over	the	world	to	build	them	and	experiment	with	us	.
So	actually	now	on	this	website	,	we	have	18,000	people	.
And	we	have	window	farms	all	over	the	world	.
What	we	're	doing	is	what	NASA	or	a	large	corporation	would	call	R	&	D	,	or	research	and	development	.
But	what	we	call	it	is	R	&	D-I-Y	,	or	research	and	develop	it	yourself	.
So	for	example	,	Jackson	came	along	and	suggested	that	we	use	air	pumps	instead	of	water	pumps	.
It	took	building	a	whole	bunch	of	systems	to	get	it	right	,	but	once	we	did	,	we	were	able	to	cut	our	carbon	footprint	nearly	in	half	.
Tony	in	Chicago	has	been	taking	on	growing	experiments	,	like	lots	of	other	window	farmers	,	and	he	's	been	able	to	get	his	strawberries	to	fruit	for	nine	months	of	the	year	in	low-light	conditions	by	simply	changing	out	the	organic	nutrients	.
And	window	farmers	in	Finland	have	been	customizing	their	window	farms	for	the	dark	days	of	the	Finnish	winters	by	outfitting	them	with	LED	grow	lights	that	they	're	now	making	open	source	and	part	of	the	project	.
So	window	farms	have	been	evolving	through	a	rapid	versioning	process	similar	to	software	.
And	with	every	open	source	project	,	the	real	benefit	is	the	interplay	between	the	specific	concerns	of	people	customizing	their	systems	for	their	own	particular	concerns	and	the	universal	concerns	.
So	my	core	team	and	I	are	able	to	concentrate	on	the	improvements	that	really	benefit	everyone	.
And	we	're	able	to	look	out	for	the	needs	of	newcomers	.
So	for	do-it-yourselfers	,	we	provide	free	,	very	well-tested	instructions	so	that	anyone	,	anywhere	around	the	world	,	can	build	one	of	these	systems	for	free	.
And	there	's	a	patent	pending	on	these	systems	as	well	that	's	held	by	the	community	.
And	to	fund	the	project	,	we	partner	to	create	products	that	we	then	sell	to	schools	and	to	individuals	who	do	n't	have	time	to	build	their	own	systems	.
Now	within	our	community	,	a	certain	culture	has	appeared	.
In	our	culture	,	it	is	better	to	be	a	tester	who	supports	someone	else	's	idea	than	it	is	to	be	just	the	idea	guy	.
What	we	get	out	of	this	project	is	we	get	support	for	our	own	work	,	as	well	as	an	experience	of	actually	contributing	to	the	environmental	movement	in	a	way	other	than	just	screwing	in	new	light	bulbs	.
But	I	think	that	Eileen	expresses	best	what	we	really	get	out	of	this	,	which	is	the	actual	joy	of	collaboration	.
So	she	expresses	here	what	it	's	like	to	see	someone	halfway	across	the	world	having	taken	your	idea	,	built	upon	it	and	then	acknowledging	you	for	contributing	.
If	we	really	want	to	see	the	kind	of	wide	consumer	behavior	change	that	we	're	all	talking	about	as	environmentalists	and	food	people	,	maybe	we	just	need	to	ditch	the	term	``	consumer	''	and	get	behind	the	people	who	are	doing	stuff	.
Open	source	projects	tend	to	have	a	momentum	of	their	own	.
And	what	we	're	seeing	is	that	R	&	D-I-Y	has	moved	beyond	just	window	farms	and	LEDs	into	solar	panels	and	aquaponic	systems	.
And	we	're	building	upon	innovations	of	generations	who	went	before	us	.
And	we	're	looking	ahead	at	generations	who	really	need	us	to	retool	our	lives	now	.
So	we	ask	that	you	join	us	in	rediscovering	the	value	of	citizens	united	,	and	to	declare	that	we	are	all	still	pioneers	.
http	:	//www.ted.com/talks/rodney_brooks_on_robots.html
In	this	prophetic	talk	from	2003	,	roboticist	Rodney	Brooks	talks	about	how	robots	are	going	to	work	their	way	into	our	lives	--	starting	with	toys	and	moving	into	household	chores	...	and	beyond	.

Rodney	Brooks	says	robots	will	invade	our	lives
What	I	want	to	tell	you	about	today	is	how	I	see	robots	invading	our	lives	at	multiple	levels	,	over	multiple	timescales	.
And	when	I	look	out	in	the	future	,	I	ca	n't	imagine	a	world	,	500	years	from	now	,	where	we	do	n't	have	robots	everywhere	.
Assuming	--	despite	all	the	dire	predictions	from	many	people	about	our	future	--	assuming	we	're	still	around	,	I	ca	n't	imagine	the	world	not	being	populated	with	robots	.
And	then	the	question	is	,	well	,	if	they	're	going	to	be	here	in	500	years	,	are	they	going	to	be	everywhere	sooner	than	that	?
Are	they	going	to	be	around	in	50	years	?
Yeah	,	I	think	that	's	pretty	likely	--	there	's	going	to	be	lots	of	robots	everywhere	.
And	in	fact	I	think	that	's	going	to	be	a	lot	sooner	than	that	.
I	think	we	're	sort	of	on	the	cusp	of	robots	becoming	common	,	and	I	think	we	're	sort	of	around	1978	or	1980	in	personal	computer	years	,	where	the	first	few	robots	are	starting	to	appear	.
Computers	sort	of	came	around	through	games	and	toys	.
And	you	know	,	the	first	computer	most	people	had	in	the	house	may	have	been	a	computer	to	play	Pong	,	a	little	microprocessor	embedded	,	and	then	other	games	that	came	after	that	.
And	we	're	starting	to	see	that	same	sort	of	thing	with	robots	:	LEGO	Mindstorms	,	Furbies	--	who	here	--	did	anyone	here	have	a	Furby	?
Yeah	,	there	's	38	million	of	them	sold	worldwide	.
They	are	pretty	common	.	And	they	're	a	little	tiny	robot	,	a	simple	robot	with	some	sensors	,	a	little	bit	of	processing	actuation	.
On	the	right	there	is	another	robot	doll	,	who	you	could	get	a	couple	of	years	ago	.
And	just	as	in	the	early	days	,	when	there	was	a	lot	of	sort	of	amateur	interaction	over	computers	,	you	can	now	get	various	hacking	kits	,	how-to-hack	books	.
And	on	the	left	there	is	a	platform	from	Evolution	Robotics	,	where	you	put	a	PC	on	,	and	you	program	this	thing	with	a	GUI	to	wander	around	your	house	and	do	various	stuff	.
And	then	there	's	a	higher	price	point	sort	of	robot	toys	--	the	Sony	Aibo	.	And	on	the	right	there	,	is	one	that	the	NEC	developed	,	the	PaPeRo	,	which	I	do	n't	think	they	're	going	to	release	.
But	nevertheless	,	those	sorts	of	things	are	out	there	.
And	we	've	seen	,	over	the	last	two	or	three	years	,	lawn-mowing	robots	,	Husqvarna	on	the	bottom	,	Friendly	Robotics	on	top	there	,	an	Israeli	company	.
And	then	in	the	last	12	months	or	so	we	've	started	to	see	a	bunch	of	home-cleaning	robots	appear	.
The	top	left	one	is	a	very	nice	home-cleaning	robot	from	a	company	called	Dyson	,	in	the	U.K	.	Except	it	was	so	expensive	--	3,500	dollars	--	they	did	n't	release	it	.
But	at	the	bottom	left	,	you	see	Electrolux	,	which	is	on	sale	.
Another	one	from	Karcher	.
At	the	bottom	right	is	one	that	I	built	in	my	lab	about	10	years	ago	,	and	we	finally	turned	that	into	a	product	.
And	let	me	just	show	you	that	.
We	're	going	to	give	this	away	I	think	,	Chris	said	,	after	the	talk	.
This	is	a	robot	that	you	can	go	out	and	buy	,	and	that	will	clean	up	your	floor	.
And	it	starts	off	sort	of	just	going	around	in	ever-increasing	circles	.
If	it	hits	something	--	you	people	see	that	?
Now	it	's	doing	wall-following	,	it	's	following	around	my	feet	to	clean	up	around	me	.	Let	's	see	,	let	's	--	oh	,	who	stole	my	Rice	Krispies	?	They	stole	my	Rice	Krispies	!
Do	n't	worry	,	relax	,	no	,	relax	,	it	's	a	robot	,	it	's	smart	!
See	,	the	three-year-old	kids	,	they	do	n't	worry	about	it	.
It	's	grown-ups	that	get	really	upset	.
We	'll	just	put	some	crap	here	.
Okay	.
I	do	n't	know	if	you	see	--	so	,	I	put	a	bunch	of	Rice	Krispies	there	,	I	put	some	pennies	,	let	's	just	shoot	it	at	that	,	see	if	it	cleans	up	.
Yeah	,	OK	.	So	--	we	'll	leave	that	for	later	.
Part	of	the	trick	was	building	a	better	cleaning	mechanism	,	actually	;	the	intelligence	on	board	was	fairly	simple	.
And	that	's	true	with	a	lot	of	robots	.
We	've	all	,	I	think	,	become	,	sort	of	computational	chauvinists	,	and	think	that	computation	is	everything	,	but	the	mechanics	still	matter	.
Here	's	another	robot	,	the	PackBot	,	that	we	've	been	building	for	a	bunch	of	years	.
It	's	a	military	surveillance	robot	,	to	go	in	ahead	of	troops	--	looking	at	caves	,	for	instance	.
But	we	had	to	make	it	fairly	robust	,	much	more	robust	than	the	robots	we	build	in	our	labs	.
On	board	that	robot	is	a	PC	running	Linux	.
It	can	withstand	a	400G	shock	.	The	robot	has	local	intelligence	:	it	can	flip	itself	over	,	can	get	itself	into	communication	range	,	can	go	upstairs	by	itself	,	et	cetera	.
Okay	,	so	it	's	doing	local	navigation	there	.
A	soldier	gives	it	a	command	to	go	upstairs	,	and	it	does	.
That	was	not	a	controlled	descent	.
Now	it	's	going	to	head	off	.
And	the	big	breakthrough	for	these	robots	,	really	,	was	September	11th	.
We	had	the	robots	down	at	the	World	Trade	Center	late	that	evening	.
Could	n't	do	a	lot	in	the	main	rubble	pile	,	things	were	just	too	--	there	was	nothing	left	to	do	.
But	we	did	go	into	all	the	surrounding	buildings	that	had	been	evacuated	,	and	searched	for	possible	survivors	in	the	buildings	that	were	too	dangerous	to	go	into	.
Let	's	run	this	video	.
Reporter	:	...	battlefield	companions	are	helping	to	reduce	the	combat	risks	.
Nick	Robertson	has	that	story	.
Rodney	Brooks	:	Can	we	have	another	one	of	these	?
Okay	,	good	.
So	,	this	is	a	corporal	who	had	seen	a	robot	two	weeks	previously	.
He	's	sending	robots	into	caves	,	looking	at	what	's	going	on	.
The	robot	's	being	totally	autonomous	.
The	worst	thing	that	's	happened	in	the	cave	so	far	was	one	of	the	robots	fell	down	ten	meters	.
So	one	year	ago	,	the	US	military	did	n't	have	these	robots	.
Now	they	're	on	active	duty	in	Afghanistan	every	day	.
And	that	's	one	of	the	reasons	they	say	a	robot	invasion	is	happening	.
There	's	a	sea	change	happening	in	how	--	where	technology	's	going	.
Thanks	.
And	over	the	next	couple	of	months	,	we	're	going	to	be	sending	robots	in	production	down	producing	oil	wells	to	get	that	last	few	years	of	oil	out	of	the	ground	.
Very	hostile	environments	,	150˚	C	,	10,000	PSI	.
Autonomous	robots	going	down	,	doing	this	sort	of	work	.
But	robots	like	this	,	they	're	a	little	hard	to	program	.
How	,	in	the	future	,	are	we	going	to	program	our	robots	and	make	them	easier	to	use	?
And	I	want	to	actually	use	a	robot	here	--	a	robot	named	Chris	--	stand	up	.	Yeah	.	Okay	.
Come	over	here	.	Now	notice	,	he	thinks	robots	have	to	be	a	bit	stiff	.
He	sort	of	does	that	.	But	I	'm	going	to	--	Chris	Anderson	:	I	'm	just	British	.	RB	:	Oh	.
I	'm	going	to	show	this	robot	a	task	.	It	's	a	very	complex	task	.
Now	notice	,	he	nodded	there	,	he	was	giving	me	some	indication	he	was	understanding	the	flow	of	communication	.
And	if	I	'd	said	something	completely	bizarre	he	would	have	looked	askance	at	me	,	and	regulated	the	conversation	.
So	now	I	brought	this	up	in	front	of	him	.
I	'd	looked	at	his	eyes	,	and	I	saw	his	eyes	looked	at	this	bottle	top	.
And	I	'm	doing	this	task	here	,	and	he	's	checking	up	.
His	eyes	are	going	back	and	forth	up	to	me	,	to	see	what	I	'm	looking	at	--	so	we	've	got	shared	attention	.
And	so	I	do	this	task	,	and	he	looks	,	and	he	looks	to	me	to	see	what	's	happening	next	.	And	now	I	'll	give	him	the	bottle	,	and	we	'll	see	if	he	can	do	the	task	.	Can	you	do	that	?
Okay	.	He	's	pretty	good	.	Yeah	.	Good	,	good	,	good	.
I	did	n't	show	you	how	to	do	that	.
Now	see	if	you	can	put	it	back	together	.
And	he	thinks	a	robot	has	to	be	really	slow	.
Good	robot	,	that	's	good	.
So	we	saw	a	bunch	of	things	there	.
We	saw	when	we	're	interacting	,	we	're	trying	to	show	someone	how	to	do	something	,	we	direct	their	visual	attention	.
The	other	thing	communicates	their	internal	state	to	us	,	whether	he	's	understanding	or	not	,	regulates	a	social	interaction	.
There	was	shared	attention	looking	at	the	same	sort	of	thing	,	and	recognizing	socially	communicated	reinforcement	at	the	end	.
And	we	've	been	trying	to	put	that	into	our	lab	robots	because	we	think	this	is	how	you	're	going	to	want	to	interact	with	robots	in	the	future	.
I	just	want	to	show	you	one	technical	diagram	here	.
The	most	important	thing	for	building	a	robot	that	you	can	interact	with	socially	is	its	visual	attention	system	.
Because	what	it	pays	attention	to	is	what	it	's	seeing	and	interacting	with	,	and	what	you	're	understanding	what	it	's	doing	.
So	in	the	videos	I	'm	about	to	show	you	,	you	're	going	to	see	a	visual	attention	system	on	a	robot	which	has	--	it	looks	for	skin	tone	in	HSV	space	,	so	it	works	across	all	human	colorings	.
It	looks	for	highly	saturated	colors	,	from	toys	.
And	it	looks	for	things	that	move	around	.
And	it	weights	those	together	into	an	attention	window	,	and	it	looks	for	the	highest-scoring	place	--	the	stuff	where	the	most	interesting	stuff	is	happening	--	and	that	is	what	its	eyes	then	segue	to	.
And	it	looks	right	at	that	.
At	the	same	time	,	some	top-down	sort	of	stuff	:	might	decide	that	it	's	lonely	and	look	for	skin	tone	,	or	might	decide	that	it	's	bored	and	look	for	a	toy	to	play	with	.
And	so	these	weights	change	.
And	over	here	on	the	right	,	this	is	what	we	call	the	Steven	Spielberg	memorial	module	.
Did	people	see	the	movie	``	AI	''	?
RB	:	Yeah	,	it	was	really	bad	,	but	--	remember	,	especially	when	Haley	Joel	Osment	,	the	little	robot	,	looked	at	the	blue	fairy	for	2,000	years	without	taking	his	eyes	off	it	?
Well	,	this	gets	rid	of	that	,	because	this	is	a	habituation	Gaussian	that	gets	negative	,	and	more	and	more	intense	as	it	looks	at	one	thing	.
And	it	gets	bored	,	so	it	will	then	look	away	at	something	else	.
So	,	once	you	've	got	that	--	and	here	's	a	robot	,	here	's	Kismet	,	looking	around	for	a	toy	.	You	can	tell	what	it	's	looking	at	.
You	can	estimate	its	gaze	direction	from	those	eyeballs	covering	its	camera	,	and	you	can	tell	when	it	's	actually	seeing	the	toy	.
And	it	's	got	a	little	bit	of	an	emotional	response	here	.
But	it	's	still	going	to	pay	attention	if	something	more	significant	comes	into	its	field	of	view	--	such	as	Cynthia	Breazeal	,	the	builder	of	this	robot	,	from	the	right	.
It	sees	her	,	pays	attention	to	her	.
Kismet	has	an	underlying	,	three-dimensional	emotional	space	,	a	vector	space	,	of	where	it	is	emotionally	.
And	at	different	places	in	that	space	,	it	expresses	--	can	we	have	the	volume	on	here	?
Can	you	hear	that	now	,	out	there	?
Kismet	:	Do	you	really	think	so	?	Do	you	really	think	so	?
Do	you	really	think	so	?
RB	:	So	it	's	expressing	its	emotion	through	its	face	and	the	prosody	in	its	voice	.
And	when	I	was	dealing	with	my	robot	over	here	,	Chris	,	the	robot	,	was	measuring	the	prosody	in	my	voice	,	and	so	we	have	the	robot	measure	prosody	for	four	basic	messages	that	mothers	give	their	children	pre-linguistically	.
Here	we	've	got	naive	subjects	praising	the	robot	:	Voice	:	Nice	robot	.
You	're	such	a	cute	little	robot	.
RB	:	And	the	robot	's	reacting	appropriately	.
Voice	:	...	very	good	,	Kismet	.
Voice	:	Look	at	my	smile	.
RB	:	It	smiles	.	She	imitates	the	smile	.	This	happens	a	lot	.
These	are	naive	subjects	.
Here	we	asked	them	to	get	the	robot	's	attention	and	indicate	when	they	have	the	robot	's	attention	.
Voice	:	Hey	,	Kismet	,	ah	,	there	it	is	.
RB	:	So	she	realizes	she	has	the	robot	's	attention	.
Voice	:	Kismet	,	do	you	like	the	toy	?	Oh	.
RB	:	Now	,	here	they	're	asked	to	prohibit	the	robot	,	and	this	first	woman	really	pushes	the	robot	into	an	emotional	corner	.
Voice	:	No	.	No	.	You	're	not	to	do	that	.	No	.
Not	appropriate	.	No	.	No	.
RB	:	I	'm	going	to	leave	it	at	that	.
We	put	that	together	.	Then	we	put	in	turn	taking	.
When	we	talk	to	someone	,	we	talk	.
Then	we	sort	of	raise	our	eyebrows	,	move	our	eyes	,	give	the	other	person	the	idea	it	's	their	turn	to	talk	.
And	then	they	talk	,	and	then	we	pass	the	baton	back	and	forth	between	each	other	.
So	we	put	this	in	the	robot	.
We	got	a	bunch	of	naive	subjects	in	,	we	did	n't	tell	them	anything	about	the	robot	,	sat	them	down	in	front	of	the	robot	and	said	,	talk	to	the	robot	.
Now	what	they	did	n't	know	was	,	the	robot	was	n't	understanding	a	word	they	said	,	and	that	the	robot	was	n't	speaking	English	.
It	was	just	saying	random	English	phonemes	.
And	I	want	you	to	watch	carefully	,	at	the	beginning	of	this	,	where	this	person	,	Ritchie	,	who	happened	to	talk	to	the	robot	for	25	minutes	--	--	says	,	``	I	want	to	show	you	something	.
I	want	to	show	you	my	watch	.	''
And	he	brings	the	watch	center	,	into	the	robot	's	field	of	vision	,	points	to	it	,	gives	it	a	motion	cue	,	and	the	robot	looks	at	the	watch	quite	successfully	.
We	do	n't	know	whether	he	understood	or	not	that	the	robot	--	Notice	the	turn-taking	.
Ritchie	:	OK	,	I	want	to	show	you	something	.	OK	,	this	is	a	watch	that	my	girlfriend	gave	me	.
Robot	:	Oh	,	cool	.
Ritchie	:	Yeah	,	look	,	it	's	got	a	little	blue	light	in	it	too	.	I	almost	lost	it	this	week	.
RB	:	So	it	's	making	eye	contact	with	him	,	following	his	eyes	.
Ritchie	:	Can	you	do	the	same	thing	?	Robot	:	Yeah	,	sure	.
RB	:	And	they	successfully	have	that	sort	of	communication	.
And	here	's	another	aspect	of	the	sorts	of	things	that	Chris	and	I	were	doing	.
This	is	another	robot	,	Cog	.
They	first	make	eye	contact	,	and	then	,	when	Christie	looks	over	at	this	toy	,	the	robot	estimates	her	gaze	direction	and	looks	at	the	same	thing	that	she	's	looking	at	.
So	we	're	going	to	see	more	and	more	of	this	sort	of	robot	over	the	next	few	years	in	labs	.
But	then	the	big	questions	,	two	big	questions	that	people	ask	me	are	:	if	we	make	these	robots	more	and	more	human-like	,	will	we	accept	them	,	will	we	--	will	they	need	rights	eventually	?
And	the	other	question	people	ask	me	is	,	will	they	want	to	take	over	?
And	on	the	first	--	you	know	,	this	has	been	a	very	Hollywood	theme	with	lots	of	movies	.	You	probably	recognize	these	characters	here	--	where	in	each	of	these	cases	,	the	robots	want	more	respect	.
Well	,	do	you	ever	need	to	give	robots	respect	?
They	're	just	machines	,	after	all	.
But	I	think	,	you	know	,	we	have	to	accept	that	we	are	just	machines	.
After	all	,	that	's	certainly	what	modern	molecular	biology	says	about	us	.
You	do	n't	see	a	description	of	how	,	you	know	,	Molecule	A	,	you	know	,	comes	up	and	docks	with	this	other	molecule	.
And	it	's	moving	forward	,	you	know	,	propelled	by	various	charges	,	and	then	the	soul	steps	in	and	tweaks	those	molecules	so	that	they	connect	.
It	's	all	mechanistic	.	We	are	mechanism	.
If	we	are	machines	,	then	in	principle	at	least	,	we	should	be	able	to	build	machines	out	of	other	stuff	,	which	are	just	as	alive	as	we	are	.
But	I	think	for	us	to	admit	that	,	we	have	to	give	up	on	our	special-ness	,	in	a	certain	way	.
And	we	've	had	the	retreat	from	special-ness	under	the	barrage	of	science	and	technology	many	times	over	the	last	few	hundred	years	,	at	least	.
500	years	ago	we	had	to	give	up	the	idea	that	we	are	the	center	of	the	universe	when	the	earth	started	to	go	around	the	sun	;	150	years	ago	,	with	Darwin	,	we	had	to	give	up	the	idea	we	were	different	from	animals	.
And	to	imagine	--	you	know	,	it	's	always	hard	for	us	.
Recently	we	've	been	battered	with	the	idea	that	maybe	we	did	n't	even	have	our	own	creation	event	,	here	on	earth	,	which	people	did	n't	like	much	.	And	then	the	human	genome	said	,	maybe	we	only	have	35,000	genes	.	And	that	was	really	--	people	did	n't	like	that	,	we	've	got	more	genes	than	that	.
We	do	n't	like	to	give	up	our	special-ness	,	so	,	you	know	,	having	the	idea	that	robots	could	really	have	emotions	,	or	that	robots	could	be	living	creatures	--	I	think	is	going	to	be	hard	for	us	to	accept	.
But	we	're	going	to	come	to	accept	it	over	the	next	50	years	or	so	.
And	the	second	question	is	,	will	the	machines	want	to	take	over	?
And	here	the	standard	scenario	is	that	we	create	these	things	,	they	grow	,	we	nurture	them	,	they	learn	a	lot	from	us	,	and	then	they	start	to	decide	that	we	're	pretty	boring	,	slow	.
They	want	to	take	over	from	us	.
And	for	those	of	you	that	have	teenagers	,	you	know	what	that	's	like	.
But	Hollywood	extends	it	to	the	robots	.
And	the	question	is	,	you	know	,	will	someone	accidentally	build	a	robot	that	takes	over	from	us	?
And	that	's	sort	of	like	this	lone	guy	in	the	backyard	,	you	know	--	``	I	accidentally	built	a	747	.	''
I	do	n't	think	that	's	going	to	happen	.
And	I	do	n't	think	--	--	I	do	n't	think	we	're	going	to	deliberately	build	robots	that	we	're	uncomfortable	with	.
We	'll	--	you	know	,	they	're	not	going	to	have	a	super	bad	robot	.
Before	that	has	to	come	to	be	a	mildly	bad	robot	,	and	before	that	a	not	so	bad	robot	.
And	we	're	just	not	going	to	let	it	go	that	way	.
So	,	I	think	I	'm	going	to	leave	it	at	that	:	the	robots	are	coming	,	we	do	n't	have	too	much	to	worry	about	,	it	's	going	to	be	a	lot	of	fun	,	and	I	hope	you	all	enjoy	the	journey	over	the	next	50	years	.

In	a	funny	,	rapid-fire	4	minutes	,	Alexis	Ohanian	of	Reddit	tells	the	real-life	fable	of	one	humpback	whale	's	rise	to	Web	stardom	.	The	lesson	of	Mister	Splashy	Pants	is	a	shoo-in	classic	for	meme-makers	and	marketers	in	the	Facebook	age	.

Alexis	Ohanian	:	How	to	make	a	splash	in	social	media
So	,	now	,	there	are	a	lot	of	web	2.0	consultants	who	make	a	lot	of	money	.
In	fact	,	they	make	their	livings	on	this	kind	of	stuff	.
I	'm	going	to	try	and	save	you	all	the	time	and	all	the	money	and	go	through	it	in	the	next	three	minutes	,	so	bear	with	me	.
Started	a	website	back	in	2005	,	with	a	few	friends	of	mine	,	called	Reddit.com	.
That	's	what	you	'd	call	a	social	news	website	.
Basically	all	that	means	is	that	the	democratic	front	page	is	the	best	stuff	on	the	web	.	You	find	some	interesting	content	,	say	a	TEDTalk	,	submit	it	to	Reddit	,	and	the	community	of	your	peers	will	vote	it	up	if	they	like	it	,	vote	it	down	if	they	do	n't	.
And	that	creates	the	front	page	.	It	's	always	rising	,	falling	,	always	changing	.
About	a	half	million	people	visit	every	day	.	But	this	is	n't	about	Reddit	.
This	is	actually	about	discovering	new	things	that	pop	up	on	the	web	.
Because	in	the	last	four	years	we	've	seen	all	kinds	of	memes	,	all	kinds	of	trends	get	born	right	on	our	front	page	.
But	this	is	n't	even	about	Reddit	itself	.
It	's	actually	about	humpback	whales	.
Well	,	okay	,	technically	it	's	actually	about	Greenpeace	,	which	is	an	environmental	organization	that	wanted	to	stop	the	Japanese	government	on	their	whaling	campaign	.
These	humpback	whales	were	getting	killed	.
They	wanted	to	put	an	end	to	it	.	And	one	of	the	ways	they	wanted	to	do	it	was	to	put	a	tracking	chip	inside	one	of	these	humpback	whales	.
But	to	really	kind	of	personify	the	movement	,	they	wanted	to	name	it	.
So	,	in	true	web	fashion	they	put	together	a	poll	where	they	had	a	bunch	of	very	erudite	,	very	thoughtful	,	cultured	names	.
I	believe	this	is	a	Farsi	word	for	``	immortal	.	''
I	think	this	means	``	divine	power	of	the	ocean	''	in	a	Polynesian	language	.
And	then	there	was	this	:	Mister	Splashy	Pants	.
And	this	,	this	was	special	.	Mister	Pants	,	or	Splashy	,	to	his	friends	,	was	very	popular	on	the	Internet	.
In	fact	,	someone	on	Reddit	thought	,	``	Oh	,	what	a	great	thing	,	we	should	all	vote	this	up	.	''
And	,	you	know	,	Redditors	responded	and	all	agreed	.
So	,	the	voting	started	and	we	actually	got	behind	it	ourselves	.
We	changed	our	logo	,	for	the	day	,	from	the	alien	to	a	Splashy	,	to	sort	of	help	the	cause	.
And	it	was	n't	long	before	other	sites	like	Fark	and	Boing	Boing	and	the	rest	of	the	Internet	started	saying	,	``	Yes	!	We	love	Splashy	Pants	.	''
So	,	it	went	from	about	five	percent	,	which	was	when	this	meme	started	,	to	70	percent	at	the	end	of	voting	.
Which	is	pretty	impressive	right	?	We	won	!	Mister	Splashy	Pants	was	chosen	.	Hmm	,	just	kidding	.	Okay	.
So	,	Greenpeace	actually	was	n't	that	crazy	about	it	,	because	they	wanted	one	of	their	more	thoughtful	names	to	win	.
So	they	said	,	``	No	,	no	,	just	kidding	.	We	'll	give	it	another	week	of	voting	.	''
Well	,	that	got	us	a	little	angry	.
So	,	we	changed	it	to	Fightin	'	Splashy	.
And	the	Reddit	community	,	really	,	and	the	rest	of	the	internet	,	rather	,	really	got	behind	this	.
Facebook	groups	were	getting	created	.	Facebook	applications	were	getting	created	.
The	idea	was	,	``	Vote	your	conscience	,	''	vote	for	Mister	Splashy	Pants	.
And	people	were	putting	up	signs	in	the	real	world	--	--	about	this	whale	.
And	this	was	the	final	vote	.	When	all	was	cleared	...
78	percent	of	the	votes	,	and	to	give	you	an	idea	of	the	landslide	,	the	next	highest	name	pulled	in	three	.	Okay	?
So	,	there	was	a	clear	lesson	here	.
And	that	was	that	the	Internet	loves	Mister	Splashy	Pants	.
Which	is	obvious	.	It	's	a	great	name	.
Everyone	wants	to	hear	their	news	anchor	say	,	``	Mister	Splashy	Pants	.	''
And	I	think	that	's	what	helped	drive	this	.
But	what	was	cool	was	that	the	repercussions	now	for	Greenpeace	was	,	they	created	an	entire	marketing	campaign	around	it	.
They	sell	Mister	Splashy	Pants	shirts	and	pins	.
They	even	created	an	e-card	so	you	could	send	your	friend	a	dancing	Splashy	.
But	what	was	even	more	important	was	the	fact	that	they	actually	accomplished	their	mission	.	The	Japanese	government	called	off	their	whaling	expedition	.	Mission	accomplished	.
Greenpeace	was	thrilled	.	The	whales	were	happy	.	That	's	a	quote	.
And	actually	,	Redditors	in	the	Internet	community	were	happy	to	participate	,	but	they	were	n't	whale	lovers	.
A	few	of	them	certainly	were	.	But	we	're	talking	about	a	lot	of	people	who	were	just	really	interested	and	really	caught	up	in	this	great	meme	,	and	in	fact	someone	from	Greenpeace	came	back	on	the	site	and	thanked	Reddit	for	its	participation	.
But	this	was	n't	really	out	of	altruism	.	This	was	just	out	of	interest	in	doing	something	cool	.
And	this	is	kind	of	how	the	Internet	works	.
This	is	that	great	big	secret	.	Because	the	Internet	provides	this	level	playing	field	.
Your	link	is	just	as	good	as	your	link	,	which	is	just	as	good	as	my	link	.	As	long	as	we	have	a	browser	,	anyone	can	get	to	any	website	no	matter	how	big	a	budget	you	have	.
That	is	,	as	long	as	you	can	keep	net	neutrality	in	place	.
The	other	important	thing	is	that	it	costs	nothing	to	get	that	content	online	now	.
There	are	so	many	great	publishing	tools	that	are	available	,	it	only	takes	a	few	minutes	of	your	time	now	to	actually	produce	something	.
And	the	cost	of	iteration	is	so	cheap	that	you	might	as	well	give	it	a	go	.
And	if	you	do	,	be	genuine	about	it	.	Be	honest	.	Be	up	front	.
And	one	of	the	great	lessons	that	Greenpeace	actually	learned	was	that	it	's	okay	to	lose	control	.
It	's	okay	to	take	yourself	a	little	less	seriously	,	given	that	,	even	though	it	's	a	very	serious	cause	,	you	could	ultimately	achieve	your	final	goal	.
And	that	's	the	final	message	that	I	want	to	share	with	all	of	you	--	that	you	can	do	well	online	.
But	no	longer	is	the	message	going	to	be	coming	from	just	the	top	down	.
If	you	want	to	succeed	you	've	got	to	be	okay	to	just	lose	control	.
Thank	you	.
http	:	//www.ted.com/talks/ian_ritchie_the_day_i_turned_down_tim_berners_lee.html
Imagine	it	's	late	1990	,	and	you	've	just	met	a	nice	young	man	named	Tim	Berners-Lee	,	who	starts	telling	you	about	his	proposed	system	called	the	World	Wide	Web	.	Ian	Ritchie	was	there	.	And	...	he	did	n't	buy	it	.	A	short	story	about	information	,	connectivity	and	learning	from	mistakes	.
business	,	history	,	technology	,	web
1244
Ian	Ritchie	:	The	day	I	turned	down	Tim	Berners-Lee
Well	we	all	know	the	World	Wide	Web	has	absolutely	transformed	publishing	,	broadcasting	,	commerce	and	social	connectivity	,	but	where	did	it	all	come	from	?
And	I	'll	quote	three	people	:	Vannevar	Bush	,	Doug	Engelbart	and	Tim	Berners-Lee	.
So	let	's	just	run	through	these	guys	.
This	is	Vannevar	Bush	.
Vannevar	Bush	was	the	U.S.	government	's	chief	scientific	adviser	during	the	war	.
And	in	1945	,	he	published	an	article	in	a	magazine	called	Atlantic	Monthly	.
And	the	article	was	called	``	As	We	May	Think	.	''
And	what	Vannevar	Bush	was	saying	was	the	way	we	use	information	is	broken	.
We	do	n't	work	in	terms	of	libraries	and	catalog	systems	and	so	forth	.
The	brain	works	by	association	.
With	one	item	in	its	thought	,	it	snaps	instantly	to	the	next	item	.
And	the	way	information	is	structured	is	totally	incapable	of	keeping	up	with	this	process	.
And	so	he	suggested	a	machine	,	and	he	called	it	the	memex	.
And	the	memex	would	link	information	,	one	piece	of	information	to	a	related	piece	of	information	and	so	forth	.
Now	this	was	in	1945	.
A	computer	in	those	days	was	something	the	secret	services	used	to	use	for	code	breaking	.
And	nobody	knew	anything	about	it	.
So	this	was	before	the	computer	was	invented	.
And	he	proposed	this	machine	called	the	memex	.
And	he	had	a	platform	where	you	linked	information	to	other	information	,	and	then	you	could	call	it	up	at	will	.
So	spinning	forward	,	one	of	the	guys	who	read	this	article	was	a	guy	called	Doug	Engelbart	,	and	he	was	a	U.S.	Air	Force	officer	.
And	he	was	reading	it	in	their	library	in	the	Far	East	.
And	he	was	so	inspired	by	this	article	,	it	kind	of	directed	the	rest	of	his	life	.
And	by	the	mid-60s	,	he	was	able	to	put	this	into	action	when	he	worked	at	the	Stanford	Research	Lab	in	California	.
He	built	a	system	.
The	system	was	designed	to	augment	human	intelligence	,	it	was	called	.
And	in	a	premonition	of	today	's	world	of	cloud	computing	and	softwares	of	service	,	his	system	was	called	NLS	for	oN-Line	System	.
And	this	is	Doug	Engelbart	.
He	was	giving	a	presentation	at	the	Fall	Joint	Computer	Conference	in	1968	.
What	he	showed	--	he	sat	on	a	stage	like	this	,	and	he	demonstrated	this	system	.
He	had	his	head	mic	like	I	've	got	.
And	he	works	this	system	.
And	you	can	see	,	he	's	working	between	documents	and	graphics	and	so	forth	.
And	he	's	driving	it	all	with	this	platform	here	,	with	a	five-finger	keyboard	and	the	world	's	first	computer	mouse	,	which	he	specially	designed	in	order	to	do	this	system	.
So	this	is	where	the	mouse	came	from	as	well	.
So	this	is	Doug	Engelbart	.
The	trouble	with	Doug	Engelbart	's	system	was	that	the	computers	in	those	days	cost	several	million	pounds	.
So	for	a	personal	computer	,	a	few	million	pounds	was	like	having	a	personal	jet	plane	;	it	was	n't	really	very	practical	.
But	spin	on	to	the	80s	when	personal	computers	did	arrive	,	then	there	was	room	for	this	kind	of	system	on	personal	computers	.
And	my	company	,	OWL	built	a	system	called	Guide	for	the	Apple	Macintosh	.
And	we	delivered	the	world	's	first	hypertext	system	.
And	this	began	to	get	a	head	of	steam	.
Apple	introduced	a	thing	called	HyperCard	,	and	they	made	a	bit	of	a	fuss	about	it	.
They	had	a	12-page	supplement	in	the	Wall	Street	Journal	the	day	it	launched	.
The	magazines	started	to	cover	it	.
Byte	magazine	and	Communications	at	the	ACM	had	special	issues	covering	hypertext	.
We	developed	a	PC	version	of	this	product	as	well	as	the	Macintosh	version	.
And	our	PC	version	became	quite	mature	.
These	are	some	examples	of	this	system	in	action	in	the	late	80s	.
You	were	able	to	deliver	documents	,	were	able	to	do	it	over	networks	.
We	developed	a	system	such	that	it	had	a	markup	language	based	on	html	.
We	called	it	hml	:	hypertext	markup	language	.
And	the	system	was	capable	of	doing	very	,	very	large	documentation	systems	over	computer	networks	.
So	I	took	this	system	to	a	trade	show	in	Versailles	near	Paris	in	late	November	1990	.
And	I	was	approached	by	a	nice	young	man	called	Tim	Berners-Lee	who	said	,	``	Are	you	Ian	Ritchie	?	''	and	I	said	,	``	Yeah	.	''
And	he	said	,	``	I	need	to	talk	to	you	.	''
And	he	told	me	about	his	proposed	system	called	the	World	Wide	Web	.
And	I	thought	,	well	,	that	's	got	a	pretentious	name	,	especially	since	the	whole	system	ran	on	his	computer	in	his	office	.
But	he	was	completely	convinced	that	his	World	Wide	Web	would	take	over	the	world	one	day	.
And	he	tried	to	persuade	me	to	write	the	browser	for	it	,	because	his	system	did	n't	have	any	graphics	or	fonts	or	layout	or	anything	;	it	was	just	plain	text	.
I	thought	,	well	,	you	know	,	interesting	,	but	a	guy	from	CERN	,	he	's	not	going	to	do	this	.
So	we	did	n't	do	it	.
In	the	next	couple	of	years	,	the	hypertext	community	did	n't	recognize	him	either	.
In	1992	,	his	paper	was	rejected	for	the	Hypertext	Conference	.
In	1993	,	there	was	a	table	at	the	conference	in	Seattle	,	and	a	guy	called	Marc	Andreessen	was	demonstrating	his	little	browser	for	the	World	Wide	Web	.
And	I	saw	it	,	and	I	thought	,	yep	,	that	's	it	.
And	the	very	next	year	,	in	1994	,	we	had	the	conference	here	in	Edinburgh	,	and	I	had	no	opposition	in	having	Tim	Berners-Lee	as	the	keynote	speaker	.
So	that	puts	me	in	pretty	illustrious	company	.
There	was	a	guy	called	Dick	Rowe	who	was	at	Decca	Records	and	turned	down	The	Beatles	.
There	was	a	guy	called	Gary	Kildall	who	went	flying	his	plane	when	IBM	came	looking	for	an	operating	system	for	the	IBM	PC	,	and	he	was	n't	there	,	so	they	went	back	to	see	Bill	Gates	.
And	the	12	publishers	who	turned	down	J.K.	Rowling	's	Harry	Potter	,	I	guess	.
On	the	other	hand	,	there	's	Marc	Andreessen	who	wrote	the	world	's	first	browser	for	the	World	Wide	Web	.
And	according	to	Fortune	magazine	,	he	's	worth	700	million	dollars	.
But	is	he	happy	?

1602
Marco	Tempest	:	A	cyber-magic	card	trick	like	no	other
Good	morning	.	So	magic	is	an	excellent	way	for	staying	ahead	of	the	reality	curve	,	to	make	possible	today	what	science	will	make	a	reality	tomorrow	.
As	a	cyber-magician	,	I	combine	elements	of	illusion	and	science	to	give	us	a	feel	of	how	future	technologies	might	be	experienced	.
You	've	probably	all	heard	of	Google	's	Project	Glass	.
It	's	new	technology	.	You	look	through	them	and	the	world	you	see	is	augmented	with	data	:	names	of	places	,	monuments	,	buildings	,	maybe	one	day	even	the	names	of	the	strangers	that	pass	you	on	the	street	.
So	these	are	my	illusion	glasses	.
They	're	a	little	bigger	.	They	're	a	prototype	.
And	when	you	look	through	them	,	you	get	a	glimpse	into	the	mind	of	the	cyber-illusionist	.
Let	me	show	you	what	I	mean	.
All	we	need	is	a	playing	card	.	Any	card	will	do	.
Like	this	.	And	let	me	mark	it	so	we	can	recognize	it	when	we	see	it	again	.
All	right	.	Very	significant	mark	.
And	let	's	put	it	back	into	the	deck	,	somewhere	in	the	middle	,	and	let	's	get	started	.
Voice	:	System	ready	.	Acquiring	image	.
Marco	Tempest	:	For	those	of	you	who	do	n't	play	cards	,	a	deck	of	cards	is	made	up	of	four	different	suits	:	hearts	,	clubs	,	diamonds	and	spades	.
The	cards	are	amongst	the	oldest	of	symbols	,	and	have	been	interpreted	in	many	different	ways	.
Now	,	some	say	that	the	four	suits	represent	the	four	seasons	.
There	's	spring	,	summer	,	autumn	and	â	Voice	:	My	favorite	season	is	winter	.	MT	:	Well	yeah	,	mine	too	.
Winter	is	like	magic	.	It	's	a	time	of	change	,	when	warmth	turns	to	cold	,	water	turns	to	snow	,	and	then	it	all	disappears	.
There	are	13	cards	in	each	suit	.
Voice	:	Each	card	represents	a	phase	of	the	13	lunar	cycles	.
MT	:	So	over	here	is	low	tide	,	and	over	here	is	high	tide	,	and	in	the	middle	is	the	moon	.
Voice	:	The	moon	is	one	of	the	most	potent	symbols	of	magic	.
MT	:	There	are	two	colors	in	a	deck	of	cards	.
There	is	the	color	red	and	the	color	black	,	representing	the	constant	change	from	day	to	night	.
Voice	:	Marco	,	I	did	not	know	you	could	do	that	.
MT	:	And	is	it	a	coincidence	that	there	are	52	cards	in	a	deck	of	cards	,	just	as	there	are	52	weeks	in	a	year	?
Voice	:	If	you	total	all	the	spots	on	a	deck	of	cards	,	the	result	is	365	.
MT	:	Oh	,	365	,	the	number	of	days	in	a	year	,	the	number	of	days	between	each	birthday	.
Make	a	wish	.
Voice	:	Do	n't	tell	,	or	it	wo	n't	come	true	.
MT	:	Well	,	as	a	matter	of	fact	,	it	was	on	my	sixth	birthday	that	I	received	my	first	deck	of	cards	,	and	ever	since	that	day	,	I	have	traveled	around	the	world	performing	magic	for	boys	and	girls	,	men	and	women	,	husbands	and	wives	,	even	kings	and	queens	.
Voice	:	And	who	are	these	?	MT	:	Ah	,	mischief-makers	.	Watch	.
Wake	up	.
Joker	:	Whoa	.	MT	:	Are	you	ready	for	your	party	piece	?
Joker	:	Ready	!	MT	:	Let	me	see	what	you	've	got	.
Joker	:	Presenting	my	pogo	stick	.	MT	:	Ah	.	Watch	out	.
Joker	:	Whoa	,	whoa	,	whoa	,	oh	!
MT	:	But	today	,	I	am	performing	for	a	different	kind	of	audience	.
I	'm	performing	for	you	.
Voice	:	Signed	card	detected	.	MT	:	Well	,	sometimes	people	ask	me	how	do	you	become	a	magician	?	Is	it	a	9-to-5	job	?
Of	course	not	!	You	've	got	to	practice	24/7	.
I	do	n't	literally	mean	24	hours	,	seven	days	a	week	.
24/7	is	a	little	bit	of	an	exaggeration	,	but	it	does	take	practice	.	Now	,	some	people	will	say	,	well	,	magic	,	that	must	be	the	work	of	some	evil	supernatural	force	.
Whoa	.
Well	,	to	this	,	I	just	say	,	no	no	.
Actually	,	in	German	,	it	's	nein	nein	.
Magic	is	n't	that	intense	.	I	have	to	warn	you	,	though	,	if	you	ever	play	with	someone	who	deals	cards	like	this	,	do	n't	play	for	money	.
Voice	:	Why	not	?	That	's	a	very	good	hand	.
The	odds	of	getting	it	are	4,165	to	one	.
MT	:	Yeah	,	but	I	guess	my	hand	is	better	.	We	beat	the	odds	.
Voice	:	I	think	you	got	your	birthday	wish	.	MT	:	And	that	actually	leaves	me	with	the	last	,	and	most	important	card	of	all	:	the	one	with	this	very	significant	mark	on	it	.
And	unlike	anything	else	we	've	just	seen	,	virtual	or	not	.	Voice	:	Signed	card	detected	.
Digital	MT	:	This	is	without	a	question	the	real	thing	.
MT	:	Bye	bye	.
Thank	you	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

Martin	Jacques	:	Understanding	the	rise	of	China
The	world	is	changing	with	really	remarkable	speed	.
If	you	look	at	the	chart	at	the	top	here	,	you	'll	see	that	in	2025	,	these	Goldman	Sachs	projections	suggest	that	the	Chinese	economy	will	be	almost	the	same	size	as	the	American	economy	.
And	if	you	look	at	the	chart	for	2050	,	it	's	projected	that	the	Chinese	economy	will	be	twice	the	size	of	the	American	economy	,	and	the	Indian	economy	will	be	almost	the	same	size	as	the	American	economy	.
And	we	should	bear	in	mind	here	that	these	projections	were	drawn	up	before	the	Western	financial	crisis	.
A	couple	of	weeks	ago	,	I	was	looking	at	the	latest	projection	by	BNP	Paribas	for	when	China	will	have	a	larger	economy	than	the	United	States	.
Goldman	Sachs	projected	2027	.
The	post-crisis	projection	is	2020	.
That	's	just	a	decade	away	.
China	is	going	to	change	the	world	in	two	fundamental	respects	.
First	of	all	,	it	's	a	huge	developing	country	with	a	population	of	1.3	billion	people	,	which	has	been	growing	for	over	30	years	at	around	10	percent	a	year	.
And	within	a	decade	,	it	will	have	the	largest	economy	in	the	world	.
Never	before	in	the	modern	era	has	the	largest	economy	in	the	world	been	that	of	a	developing	country	,	rather	than	a	developed	country	.
Secondly	,	for	the	first	time	in	the	modern	era	,	the	dominant	country	in	the	world	--	which	I	think	is	what	China	will	become	--	will	be	not	from	the	West	and	from	very	,	very	different	civilizational	roots	.
Now	,	I	know	it	's	a	widespread	assumption	in	the	West	that	as	countries	modernize	,	they	also	westernize	.
This	is	an	illusion	.
It	's	an	assumption	that	modernity	is	a	product	simply	of	competition	,	markets	and	technology	.
It	is	not	.	It	is	also	shaped	equally	by	history	and	culture	.
China	is	not	like	the	West	,	and	it	will	not	become	like	the	West	.
It	will	remain	in	very	fundamental	respects	very	different	.
Now	the	big	question	here	is	obviously	,	how	do	we	make	sense	of	China	?
How	do	we	try	to	understand	what	China	is	?
And	the	problem	we	have	in	the	West	at	the	moment	,	by	and	large	,	is	that	the	conventional	approach	is	that	we	understand	it	really	in	Western	terms	,	using	Western	ideas	.
We	ca	n't	.
Now	I	want	to	offer	you	three	building	blocks	for	trying	to	understand	what	China	is	like	,	just	as	a	beginning	.
The	first	is	this	:	that	China	is	not	really	a	nation-state	.
Okay	,	it	's	called	itself	a	nation-state	for	the	last	hundred	years	,	but	everyone	who	knows	anything	about	China	knows	it	's	a	lot	older	than	this	.
This	was	what	China	looked	like	with	the	victory	of	the	Qin	Dynasty	in	221	B.C	.	at	the	end	of	the	warring-state	period	--	the	birth	of	modern	China	.
And	you	can	see	it	against	the	boundaries	of	modern	China	.
Or	immediately	afterward	,	the	Han	Dynasty	,	still	2,000	years	ago	.
And	you	can	see	already	it	occupies	most	of	what	we	now	know	as	Eastern	China	,	which	is	where	the	vast	majority	of	Chinese	lived	then	and	live	now	.
Now	what	is	extraordinary	about	this	is	,	what	gives	China	its	sense	of	being	China	,	what	gives	the	Chinese	the	sense	of	what	it	is	to	be	Chinese	,	comes	not	from	the	last	hundred	years	,	not	from	the	nation-state	period	,	which	is	what	happened	in	the	West	,	but	from	the	period	,	if	you	like	,	of	the	civilization-state	.
I	'm	thinking	here	,	for	example	,	of	customs	like	ancestral	worship	,	of	a	very	distinctive	notion	of	the	state	,	likewise	,	a	very	distinctive	notion	of	the	family	,	social	relationships	like	guanxi	,	Confucian	values	and	so	on	.
These	are	all	things	that	come	from	the	period	of	the	civilization-state	.
In	other	words	,	China	,	unlike	the	Western	states	and	most	countries	in	the	world	,	is	shaped	by	its	sense	of	civilization	,	its	existence	as	a	civilization-state	,	rather	than	as	a	nation-state	.
And	there	's	one	other	thing	to	add	to	this	,	and	that	is	this	:	Of	course	we	know	China	's	big	,	huge	,	demographically	and	geographically	,	with	a	population	of	1.3	billion	people	.
What	we	often	are	n't	really	aware	of	is	the	fact	that	China	is	extremely	diverse	and	very	pluralistic	,	and	in	many	ways	very	decentralized	.
You	ca	n't	run	a	place	on	this	scale	simply	from	Beijing	,	even	though	we	think	this	to	be	the	case	.
It	's	never	been	the	case	.
So	this	is	China	,	a	civilization-state	,	rather	than	a	nation-state	.
And	what	does	it	mean	?
Well	,	I	think	it	has	all	sorts	of	profound	implications	.
I	'll	give	you	two	quick	ones	.
The	first	is	that	the	most	important	political	value	for	the	Chinese	is	unity	,	is	the	maintenance	of	Chinese	civilization	.
You	know	,	2,000	years	ago	,	Europe	:	breakdown	--	the	fragmentation	of	the	Holy	Roman	Empire	.
It	divided	,	and	it	's	remained	divided	ever	since	.
China	,	over	the	same	time	period	,	went	in	exactly	the	opposite	direction	,	very	painfully	holding	this	huge	civilization	,	civilization-state	,	together	.
The	second	is	maybe	more	prosaic	,	which	is	Hong	Kong	.
Do	you	remember	the	handover	of	Hong	Kong	by	Britain	to	China	in	1997	?
You	may	remember	what	the	Chinese	constitutional	proposition	was	.
One	country	,	two	systems	.
And	I	'll	lay	a	wager	that	barely	anyone	in	the	West	believed	them	.
``	Window	dressing	.
When	China	gets	its	hands	on	Hong	Kong	,	that	wo	n't	be	the	case	.	''
Thirteen	years	on	,	the	political	and	legal	system	in	Hong	Kong	is	as	different	now	as	it	was	in	1997	.
We	were	wrong	.	Why	were	we	wrong	?
We	were	wrong	because	we	thought	,	naturally	enough	,	in	nation-state	ways	.
Think	of	German	unification	,	1990	.
What	happened	?
Well	,	basically	the	East	was	swallowed	by	the	West	.
One	nation	,	one	system	.
That	is	the	nation-state	mentality	.
But	you	ca	n't	run	a	country	like	China	,	a	civilization-state	,	on	the	basis	of	one	civilization	,	one	system	.
It	does	n't	work	.
So	actually	the	response	of	China	to	the	question	of	Hong	Kong	--	as	it	will	be	to	the	question	of	Taiwan	--	was	a	natural	response	:	one	civilization	,	many	systems	.
Let	me	offer	you	another	building	block	to	try	and	understand	China	--	maybe	not	sort	of	a	comfortable	one	.
The	Chinese	have	a	very	,	very	different	conception	of	race	to	most	other	countries	.
Do	you	know	,	of	the	1.3	billion	Chinese	,	over	90	percent	of	them	think	they	belong	to	the	same	race	,	the	Han	?
Now	,	this	is	completely	different	from	the	world	's	[	other	]	most	populous	countries	.
India	,	the	United	States	,	Indonesia	,	Brazil	--	all	of	them	are	multiracial	.
The	Chinese	do	n't	feel	like	that	.
China	is	only	multiracial	really	at	the	margins	.
So	the	question	is	,	why	?
Well	the	reason	,	I	think	,	essentially	is	,	again	,	back	to	the	civilization-state	.
A	history	of	at	least	2,000	years	,	a	history	of	conquest	,	occupation	,	absorption	,	assimilation	and	so	on	,	led	to	the	process	by	which	,	over	time	,	this	notion	of	the	Han	emerged	--	of	course	,	nurtured	by	a	growing	and	very	powerful	sense	of	cultural	identity	.
Now	the	great	advantage	of	this	historical	experience	has	been	that	,	without	the	Han	,	China	could	never	have	held	together	.
The	Han	identity	has	been	the	cement	which	has	held	this	country	together	.
The	great	disadvantage	of	it	is	that	the	Han	have	a	very	weak	conception	of	cultural	difference	.
They	really	believe	in	their	own	superiority	,	and	they	are	disrespectful	of	those	who	are	not	.
Hence	their	attitude	,	for	example	,	to	the	Uyghurs	and	to	the	Tibetans	.
Or	let	me	give	you	my	third	building	block	,	the	Chinese	state	.
Now	the	relationship	between	the	state	and	society	in	China	is	very	different	from	that	in	the	West	.
Now	we	in	the	West	overwhelmingly	seem	to	think	--	in	these	days	at	least	--	that	the	authority	and	legitimacy	of	the	state	is	a	function	of	democracy	.
The	problem	with	this	proposition	is	that	the	Chinese	state	enjoys	more	legitimacy	and	more	authority	amongst	the	Chinese	than	is	true	with	any	Western	state	.
And	the	reason	for	this	is	because	--	well	,	there	are	two	reasons	,	I	think	.
And	it	's	obviously	got	nothing	to	do	with	democracy	,	because	in	our	terms	the	Chinese	certainly	do	n't	have	a	democracy	.
And	the	reason	for	this	is	,	firstly	,	because	the	state	in	China	is	given	a	very	special	--	it	enjoys	a	very	special	significance	as	the	representative	,	the	embodiment	and	the	guardian	of	Chinese	civilization	,	of	the	civilization-state	.
This	is	as	close	as	China	gets	to	a	kind	of	spiritual	role	.
And	the	second	reason	is	because	,	whereas	in	Europe	and	North	America	,	the	state	's	power	is	continuously	challenged	--	I	mean	in	the	European	tradition	,	historically	against	the	church	,	against	other	sectors	of	the	aristocracy	,	against	merchants	and	so	on	--	for	1,000	years	,	the	power	of	the	Chinese	state	has	not	been	challenged	.
It	's	had	no	serious	rivals	.
So	you	can	see	that	the	way	in	which	power	has	been	constructed	in	China	is	very	different	from	our	experience	in	Western	history	.
The	result	,	by	the	way	,	is	that	the	Chinese	have	a	very	different	view	of	the	state	.
Whereas	we	tend	to	view	it	as	an	intruder	,	a	stranger	,	certainly	an	organ	whose	powers	need	to	be	limited	or	defined	and	constrained	,	the	Chinese	do	n't	see	the	state	like	that	at	all	.
The	Chinese	view	the	state	as	an	intimate	--	not	just	as	an	intimate	actually	,	as	a	member	of	the	family	--	not	just	in	fact	as	a	member	of	the	family	,	but	as	the	head	of	the	family	,	the	patriarch	of	the	family	.
This	is	the	Chinese	view	of	the	state	--	very	,	very	different	to	ours	.
It	's	embedded	in	society	in	a	different	kind	of	way	to	what	is	the	case	in	the	West	.
And	I	would	suggest	to	you	that	actually	what	we	are	dealing	with	here	,	in	the	Chinese	context	,	is	a	new	kind	of	paradigm	,	which	is	different	from	anything	we	've	had	to	think	about	in	the	past	.
Know	that	China	believes	in	the	market	and	the	state	.
I	mean	,	Adam	Smith	,	already	writing	in	the	late	18th	century	,	said	,	``	The	Chinese	market	is	larger	and	more	developed	and	more	sophisticated	than	anything	in	Europe	.	''
And	,	apart	from	the	Mao	period	,	that	has	remained	more	or	less	the	case	ever	since	.
But	this	is	combined	with	an	extremely	strong	and	ubiquitous	state	.
The	state	is	everywhere	in	China	.
I	mean	,	it	's	leading	firms	--	many	of	them	are	still	publicly	owned	.
Private	firms	,	however	large	they	are	,	like	Lenovo	,	depend	in	many	ways	on	state	patronage	.
Targets	for	the	economy	and	so	on	are	set	by	the	state	.
And	the	state	,	of	course	,	its	authority	flows	into	lots	of	other	areas	--	as	we	are	familiar	with	--	with	something	like	the	one-child	policy	.
Moreover	,	this	is	a	very	old	state	tradition	,	a	very	old	tradition	of	statecraft	.
I	mean	,	if	you	want	an	illustration	of	this	,	the	Great	Wall	is	one	.
But	this	is	another	,	this	is	the	Grand	Canal	,	which	was	constructed	in	the	first	instance	in	the	fifth	century	B.C	.
and	was	finally	completed	in	the	seventh	century	A.D	.
It	went	for	1,114	miles	,	linking	Beijing	with	Hangzhou	and	Shanghai	.
So	there	's	a	long	history	of	extraordinary	state	infrastructural	projects	in	China	,	which	I	suppose	helps	us	to	explain	what	we	see	today	,	which	is	something	like	the	Three	Gorges	Dam	and	many	other	expressions	of	state	competence	within	China	.
So	there	we	have	three	building	blocks	for	trying	to	understand	the	difference	that	is	China	--	the	civilization-state	,	the	notion	of	race	and	the	nature	of	the	state	and	its	relationship	to	society	.
And	yet	we	still	insist	,	by	and	large	,	in	thinking	that	we	can	understand	China	by	simply	drawing	on	Western	experience	,	looking	at	it	through	Western	eyes	,	using	Western	concepts	.
If	you	want	to	know	why	we	unerringly	seem	to	get	China	wrong	--	our	predictions	about	what	's	going	to	happen	to	China	are	incorrect	--	this	is	the	reason	.
Unfortunately	,	I	think	,	I	have	to	say	that	I	think	attitude	towards	China	is	that	of	a	kind	of	little	Westerner	mentality	.
It	's	kind	of	arrogant	.
It	's	arrogant	in	the	sense	that	we	think	that	we	are	best	,	and	therefore	we	have	the	universal	measure	.
And	secondly	,	it	's	ignorant	.
We	refuse	to	really	address	the	issue	of	difference	.
You	know	,	there	's	a	very	interesting	passage	in	a	book	by	Paul	Cohen	,	the	American	historian	.
And	Paul	Cohen	argues	that	the	West	thinks	of	itself	as	probably	the	most	cosmopolitan	of	all	cultures	.
But	it	's	not	.
In	many	ways	,	it	's	the	most	parochial	,	because	for	200	years	,	the	West	has	been	so	dominant	in	the	world	that	it	's	not	really	needed	to	understand	other	cultures	,	other	civilizations	.
Because	,	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	it	could	,	if	necessary	by	force	,	get	its	own	way	.
Whereas	those	cultures	--	virtually	the	rest	of	the	world	,	in	fact	,	which	have	been	in	a	far	weaker	position	,	vis-a-vis	the	West	--	have	been	thereby	forced	to	understand	the	West	,	because	of	the	West	's	presence	in	those	societies	.
And	therefore	,	they	are	,	as	a	result	,	more	cosmopolitan	in	many	ways	than	the	West	.
I	mean	,	take	the	question	of	East	Asia	.
East	Asia	:	Japan	,	Korea	,	China	,	etc	.	--	a	third	of	the	world	's	population	lives	there	.
Now	the	largest	economic	region	in	the	world	.
And	I	'll	tell	you	now	,	that	East	Asianers	,	people	from	East	Asia	,	are	far	more	knowledgeable	about	the	West	than	the	West	is	about	East	Asia	.
Now	this	point	is	very	germane	,	I	'm	afraid	,	to	the	present	.
Because	what	's	happening	?	Back	to	that	chart	at	the	beginning	,	the	Goldman	Sachs	chart	.
What	is	happening	is	that	,	very	rapidly	in	historical	terms	,	the	world	is	being	driven	and	shaped	,	not	by	the	old	developed	countries	,	but	by	the	developing	world	.
We	've	seen	this	in	terms	of	the	G20	usurping	very	rapidly	the	position	of	the	G7	,	or	the	G8	.
And	there	are	two	consequences	of	this	.
First	,	the	West	is	rapidly	losing	its	influence	in	the	world	.
There	was	a	dramatic	illustration	of	this	actually	a	year	ago	--	Copenhagen	,	climate	change	conference	.
Europe	was	not	at	the	final	negotiating	table	.
When	did	that	last	happen	?
I	would	wager	it	was	probably	about	200	years	ago	.
And	that	is	what	is	going	to	happen	in	the	future	.
And	the	second	implication	is	that	the	world	will	inevitably	,	as	a	consequence	,	become	increasingly	unfamiliar	to	us	,	because	it	'll	be	shaped	by	cultures	and	experiences	and	histories	that	we	are	not	really	familiar	with	,	or	conversant	with	.
And	at	last	,	I	'm	afraid	--	take	Europe	;	America	is	slightly	different	--	but	Europeans	by	and	large	,	I	have	to	say	,	are	ignorant	,	are	unaware	about	the	way	the	world	is	changing	.
Some	people	--	I	've	got	an	English	friend	in	China	,	and	he	said	,	``	The	continent	is	sleepwalking	into	oblivion	.	''
Well	,	maybe	that	's	true	,	maybe	that	's	an	exaggeration	.
But	there	's	another	problem	which	goes	along	with	this	--	that	Europe	is	increasingly	out	of	touch	with	the	world	--	and	that	is	a	sort	of	loss	of	a	sense	of	the	future	.
I	mean	,	Europe	once	,	of	course	,	once	commanded	the	future	in	its	confidence	.
Take	the	19th	century	,	for	example	.
But	this	,	alas	,	is	no	longer	true	.
If	you	want	to	feel	the	future	,	if	you	want	to	taste	the	future	,	try	China	--	there	's	old	Confucius	.
This	is	a	railway	station	the	likes	of	which	you	've	never	seen	before	.
It	does	n't	even	look	like	a	railway	station	.
This	is	the	new	Guangzhou	railway	station	for	the	high-speed	trains	.
China	already	has	a	bigger	network	than	any	other	country	in	the	world	and	will	soon	have	more	than	all	the	rest	of	the	world	put	together	.
Or	take	this	:	now	this	is	an	idea	,	but	it	's	an	idea	to	be	tried	out	shortly	in	a	suburb	of	Beijing	.
Here	you	have	a	megabus	,	on	the	upper	deck	carries	about	2,000	people	.
It	travels	on	rails	down	a	suburban	road	,	and	the	cars	travel	underneath	it	.
And	it	does	speeds	of	up	to	about	100	miles	an	hour	.
Now	this	is	the	way	things	are	going	to	move	,	because	China	has	a	very	specific	problem	,	which	is	different	from	Europe	and	different	from	the	United	States	:	China	has	huge	numbers	of	people	and	no	space	.
So	this	is	a	solution	to	a	situation	where	China	's	going	to	have	many	,	many	,	many	cities	over	20	million	people	.
Okay	,	so	how	would	I	like	to	finish	?
Well	,	what	should	our	attitude	be	towards	this	world	that	we	see	very	rapidly	developing	before	us	?
I	think	there	will	be	good	things	about	it	and	there	will	be	bad	things	about	it	.
But	I	want	to	argue	,	above	all	,	a	big-picture	positive	for	this	world	.
For	200	years	,	the	world	was	essentially	governed	by	a	fragment	of	the	human	population	.
That	's	what	Europe	and	North	America	represented	.
The	arrival	of	countries	like	China	and	India	--	between	them	38	percent	of	the	world	's	population	--	and	others	like	Indonesia	and	Brazil	and	so	on	,	represent	the	most	important	single	act	of	democratization	in	the	last	200	years	.
Civilizations	and	cultures	,	which	had	been	ignored	,	which	had	no	voice	,	which	were	not	listened	to	,	which	were	not	known	about	,	will	have	a	different	sort	of	representation	in	this	world	.
As	humanists	,	we	must	welcome	,	surely	,	this	transformation	,	and	we	will	have	to	learn	about	these	civilizations	.
This	big	ship	here	was	the	one	sailed	in	by	Zheng	He	in	the	early	15th	century	on	his	great	voyages	around	the	South	China	Sea	,	the	East	China	Sea	and	across	the	Indian	Ocean	to	East	Africa	.
The	little	boat	in	front	of	it	was	the	one	in	which	,	80	years	later	,	Christopher	Columbus	crossed	the	Atlantic	.
Or	,	look	carefully	at	this	silk	scroll	made	by	ZhuZhou	in	1368	.
I	think	they	're	playing	golf	.
Christ	,	the	Chinese	even	invented	golf	.
Welcome	to	the	future	.	Thank	you	.

As	globalization	and	technological	advances	bring	us	hurtling	towards	a	new	integrated	future	,	Ian	Goldin	warns	that	not	all	people	may	benefit	equally	.	But	,	he	says	,	if	we	can	recognize	this	danger	,	we	might	yet	realize	the	possibility	of	improved	life	for	everyone	.

Ian	Goldin	:	Navigating	our	global	future
The	future	,	as	we	know	it	,	is	very	unpredictable	.
The	best	minds	in	the	best	institutions	generally	get	it	wrong	.
This	is	in	technology	.	This	is	in	the	area	of	politics	,	where	pundits	,	the	CIA	,	MI6	always	get	it	wrong	.
And	it	's	clearly	in	the	area	of	finance	.
With	institutions	established	to	think	about	the	future	,	the	IMF	,	the	BIS	,	the	Financial	Stability	Forum	,	could	n't	see	what	was	coming	.
Over	20,000	economists	whose	job	it	is	,	competitive	entry	to	get	there	,	could	n't	see	what	was	happening	.
Globalization	is	getting	more	complex	.
And	this	change	is	getting	more	rapid	.
The	future	will	be	more	unpredictable	.
coming	together	,	leads	to	a	new	renaissance	.
It	did	this	a	thousand	years	ago	.
The	last	40	years	have	been	extraordinary	times	.
Life	expectancy	has	gone	up	by	about	25	years	.
It	took	from	the	Stone	Age	to	achieve	that	.
Income	has	gone	up	for	a	majority	of	the	world	's	population	,	despite	the	population	going	up	by	about	two	billion	people	over	this	period	.
And	illiteracy	has	gone	down	,	from	a	half	to	about	a	quarter	of	the	people	on	Earth	.
A	huge	opportunity	,	unleashing	of	new	potential	for	innovation	,	for	development	.
But	there	is	an	underbelly	.
There	are	two	Achilles	'	heels	of	globalization	.
There	is	the	Achilles	'	heel	of	growing	inequality	--	those	that	are	left	out	,	those	that	feel	angry	,	those	that	are	not	participating	.	Globalization	has	not	been	inclusive	.
The	second	Achilles	'	heel	is	complexity	--	a	growing	fragility	,	a	growing	brittleness	.
What	happens	in	one	place	very	quickly	affects	everything	else	.
This	is	a	systemic	risk	,	systemic	shock	.
We	've	seen	it	in	the	financial	crisis	.	We	've	seen	it	in	the	pandemic	flu	.
It	will	become	virulent	and	it	's	something	we	have	to	build	resilience	against	.
A	lot	of	this	is	driven	by	what	's	happening	in	technology	.
There	have	been	huge	leaps	.	There	will	be	a	million-fold	improvement	in	what	you	can	get	for	the	same	price	in	computing	by	2030	.
That	's	what	the	experience	of	the	last	20	years	has	been	.
It	will	continue	.
Our	computers	,	our	systems	will	be	as	primitive	as	the	Apollo	's	are	for	today	.
Our	mobile	phones	are	more	powerful	than	the	total	Apollo	space	engine	.
Our	mobile	phones	are	more	powerful	than	some	of	the	strongest	computers	of	20	years	ago	.
So	what	will	this	do	?
It	will	create	huge	opportunities	in	technology	.
Miniaturization	as	well	.
There	will	be	invisible	capacity	.	Invisible	capacity	in	our	bodies	,	in	our	brains	,	and	in	the	air	.
This	is	a	dust	mite	on	a	nanoreplica	.
This	sort	of	ability	to	do	everything	in	new	ways	unleashes	potential	,	not	least	in	the	area	of	medicine	.
This	is	a	stem	cell	that	we	've	developed	here	in	Oxford	,	from	an	embryonic	stem	cell	.
We	can	develop	any	part	of	the	body	.
Increasingly	,	over	time	,	this	will	be	possible	from	our	own	skin	--	able	to	replicate	parts	of	the	body	.
Fantastic	potential	for	regenerative	medicine	.
I	do	n't	think	there	will	be	a	Special	Olympics	long	after	2030	,	because	of	this	capacity	to	regenerate	parts	of	the	body	.
But	the	question	is	,	``	Who	will	have	it	?	''
The	other	major	development	is	going	to	be	in	the	area	of	what	can	happen	in	genetics	.
The	capacity	to	create	,	as	this	mouse	has	been	genetically	modified	,	something	which	goes	three	times	faster	,	lasts	for	three	times	longer	,	we	could	produce	,	as	this	mouse	can	,	to	the	age	of	our	equivalent	of	80	years	,	using	about	the	same	amount	of	food	.
But	will	this	only	be	available	for	the	super	rich	,	for	those	that	can	afford	it	?	Are	we	headed	for	a	new	eugenics	?
Will	only	those	that	are	able	to	afford	it	be	able	to	be	this	super	race	of	the	future	?
So	the	big	question	for	us	is	,	``	How	do	we	manage	this	technological	change	?	''
How	do	we	ensure	that	it	creates	a	more	inclusive	technology	,	a	technology	which	means	that	not	only	as	we	grow	older	,	that	we	can	also	grow	wiser	,	and	that	we	're	able	to	support	the	populations	of	the	future	?
One	of	the	most	dramatic	manifestations	of	these	improvements	will	be	moving	from	population	pyramids	to	what	we	might	term	population	coffins	.
There	is	unlikely	to	be	a	pension	or	a	retirement	age	in	2030	.
These	will	be	redundant	concepts	.	And	this	is	n't	only	something	of	the	West	.
The	most	dramatic	changes	will	be	the	skyscraper	type	of	new	pyramids	that	will	take	place	in	China	and	in	many	other	countries	.
So	forget	about	retirements	if	you	're	young	.
Forget	about	pensions	.	Think	about	life	and	where	it	's	going	to	be	going	.
Of	course	,	migration	will	become	even	more	important	.
The	war	on	talent	,	the	need	to	attract	people	at	all	skill	ranges	,	to	push	us	around	in	our	wheelchairs	,	but	also	to	drive	our	economies	.	Our	innovation	will	be	vital	.
The	employment	in	the	rich	countries	will	go	down	from	about	800	to	about	700	million	of	these	people	.
This	would	imply	a	massive	leap	in	migration	.
So	the	concerns	,	the	xenophobic	concerns	of	today	,	of	migration	,	will	be	turned	on	their	head	,	as	we	search	for	people	to	help	us	sort	out	our	pensions	and	our	economies	in	the	future	.
And	then	,	the	systemic	risks	.
We	understand	that	these	will	become	much	more	virulent	,	that	what	we	see	today	is	this	interweaving	of	societies	,	of	systems	,	fastened	by	technologies	and	hastened	by	just-in-time	management	systems	.
Small	levels	of	stock	push	resilience	into	other	people	's	responsibility	.
The	collapse	in	biodiversity	,	climate	change	,	pandemics	,	financial	crises	:	these	will	be	the	currency	that	we	will	think	about	.
And	so	a	new	awareness	will	have	to	arise	,	of	how	we	deal	with	these	,	how	we	mobilize	ourselves	,	in	a	new	way	,	and	come	together	as	a	community	to	manage	systemic	risk	.
It	's	going	to	require	innovation	.
It	's	going	to	require	an	understanding	that	the	glory	of	globalization	could	also	be	its	downfall	.
This	could	be	our	best	century	ever	because	of	the	achievements	,	or	it	could	be	our	worst	.
And	of	course	we	need	to	worry	about	the	individuals	,	particularly	the	individuals	that	feel	that	they	've	been	left	out	in	one	way	or	another	.
An	individual	,	for	the	first	time	in	the	history	of	humanity	,	will	have	the	capacity	,	by	2030	,	to	destroy	the	planet	,	to	wreck	everything	,	through	the	creation	,	for	example	,	of	a	biopathogen	.
How	do	we	begin	to	weave	these	tapestries	together	?
How	do	we	think	about	complex	systems	in	new	ways	?
That	will	be	the	challenge	of	the	scholars	,	and	of	all	of	us	engaged	in	thinking	about	the	future	.
The	rest	of	our	lives	will	be	in	the	future	.	We	need	to	prepare	for	it	now	.
We	need	to	understand	that	the	governance	structure	in	the	world	is	fossilized	.
It	can	not	begin	to	cope	with	the	challenges	that	this	will	bring	.
We	have	to	develop	a	new	way	of	managing	the	planet	,	collectively	,	through	collective	wisdom	.
We	know	,	and	I	know	from	my	own	experience	,	that	amazing	things	can	happen	,	when	individuals	and	societies	come	together	to	change	their	future	.
I	left	South	Africa	,	and	15	years	later	,	after	thinking	I	would	never	go	back	,	I	had	the	privilege	and	the	honor	to	work	in	the	government	of	Nelson	Mandela	.
This	was	a	miracle	.	We	can	create	miracles	,	collectively	,	in	our	lifetime	.
It	is	vital	that	we	do	so	.
It	is	vital	that	the	ideas	that	are	nurtured	in	TED	,	that	the	ideas	that	we	think	about	look	forward	,	and	make	sure	that	this	will	be	the	most	glorious	century	,	and	not	one	of	eco-disaster	and	eco-collapse	.
Thank	you	.

Raghava	KK	:	Five	lives	of	an	artist
I	think	it	was	in	my	second	grade	that	I	was	caught	drawing	the	bust	of	a	nude	by	Michelangelo	.
I	was	sent	straight	away	to	my	school	principal	,	and	my	school	principal	,	a	sweet	nun	,	looked	at	my	book	with	disgust	,	flipped	through	the	pages	,	saw	all	the	nudes	--	you	know	,	I	'd	been	seeing	my	mother	draw	nudes	and	I	'd	copy	her	--	and	the	nun	slapped	me	on	my	face	and	said	,	``	Sweet	Jesus	,	this	kid	has	already	begun	.	''
I	had	no	clue	what	she	was	talking	about	,	but	it	was	convincing	enough	for	me	never	to	draw	again	until	the	ninth	grade	.
Thanks	to	a	really	boring	lecture	,	I	started	caricaturing	my	teachers	in	school	.
And	,	you	know	,	I	got	a	lot	of	popularity	.
I	do	n't	play	sports	.	I	'm	really	bad	at	sports	.
I	do	n't	have	the	fanciest	gadgets	at	home	.
I	'm	not	on	top	of	the	class	.
So	for	me	,	cartooning	gave	me	a	sense	of	identity	.
I	got	popular	,	but	I	was	scared	I	'd	get	caught	again	.
So	what	I	did	was	I	quickly	put	together	a	collage	of	all	the	teachers	I	had	drawn	,	glorified	my	school	principal	,	put	him	right	on	top	,	and	gifted	it	to	him	.
He	had	a	good	laugh	at	the	other	teachers	and	put	it	up	on	the	notice	board	.
This	is	a	part	of	that	.
And	I	became	a	school	hero	.
All	my	seniors	knew	me	.	I	felt	really	special	.
I	have	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	my	family	.
That	's	my	mother	.	I	love	her	to	bits	.
She	's	the	one	who	taught	me	how	to	draw	and	,	more	importantly	,	how	to	love	.
She	's	a	bit	of	a	hippie	.
She	said	,	``	Do	n't	say	that	,	''	but	I	'm	saying	it	anyway	.
The	rest	of	my	family	are	boring	academics	,	busy	collecting	Ivy	League	decals	for	our	classic	Ambassador	car	.
My	father	's	a	little	different	.
My	father	believed	in	a	holistic	approach	to	living	,	and	,	you	know	,	every	time	he	taught	us	,	he	'd	say	,	``	I	hate	these	books	,	because	these	books	are	hijacked	by	Industrial	Revolution	.	''
While	he	still	held	that	worldview	,	I	was	16	,	I	got	the	best	lawyer	in	town	,	my	older	brother	Karthik	,	and	I	sat	him	down	,	and	I	said	,	``	Pa	,	from	today	onwards	I	've	decided	I	'm	going	to	be	disciplined	,	I	'm	going	to	be	curious	,	I	'm	going	to	learn	something	new	every	day	,	I	'm	going	to	be	very	hard	working	,	and	I	'm	not	going	to	depend	on	you	emotionally	or	financially	.	''
And	he	was	very	impressed	.	He	was	all	tearing	up	.	Ready	to	hug	me	.
And	I	said	,	``	Hold	that	thought	.	''
I	said	,	``	Can	I	quit	school	then	?	''
But	,	to	cut	a	long	story	short	,	I	quit	school	to	pursue	a	career	as	a	cartoonist	.
I	must	have	done	about	30,000	caricatures	.
I	would	do	birthday	parties	,	weddings	,	divorces	,	anything	for	anyone	who	wanted	to	use	my	services	.
But	,	most	importantly	,	while	I	was	traveling	,	I	taught	children	cartooning	,	and	in	exchange	,	I	learned	how	to	be	spontaneous	.
And	mad	and	crazy	and	fun	.
When	I	started	teaching	them	,	I	said	let	me	start	doing	this	professionally	.
When	I	was	18	I	started	my	own	school	.
However	,	an	18	year-old	trying	to	start	a	school	is	not	easy	unless	you	have	a	big	patron	or	a	big	supporter	.
So	I	was	flipping	through	the	pages	of	the	Times	of	India	when	I	saw	that	the	Prime	Minister	of	India	was	visiting	my	home	town	,	Bangalore	.
And	,	you	know	,	just	like	how	every	cartoonist	knows	Bush	here	,	and	if	you	had	to	meet	Bush	,	it	would	be	the	funnest	thing	because	his	face	was	a	cartoonist	's	delight	.
I	had	to	meet	my	Prime	Minister	.
I	went	to	the	place	where	his	helicopter	was	about	to	land	.
I	saw	layers	of	security	.
I	caricatured	my	way	through	three	layers	by	just	impressing	the	guards	,	but	I	got	stuck	.	I	got	stuck	at	the	third	.
And	what	happened	was	,	to	my	luck	,	I	saw	a	nuclear	scientist	at	whose	party	I	had	done	cartoons	.
I	ran	up	to	him	,	and	said	,	``	Hello	,	sir	.	How	do	you	do	?	''
He	said	,	``	What	are	you	doing	here	,	Raghava	?	''
I	said	,	``	I	'm	here	to	meet	the	Prime	Minister	.	''
He	said	,	``	Oh	,	so	am	I	.	''
I	hopped	into	his	car	,	and	off	we	went	through	the	remaining	layers	of	security	.
Thank	you	.
I	sat	him	down	,	I	caricatured	him	,	and	since	then	I	've	caricatured	hundreds	of	celebrities	.
This	is	one	I	remember	fondly	.
Salman	Rushdie	was	pissed-off	I	think	because	I	altered	the	map	of	New	York	,	if	you	notice	.
Anyway	,	the	next	slide	I	'm	about	to	show	you	--	Should	I	just	turn	that	off	?
The	next	slide	I	'm	about	to	show	you	,	is	a	little	more	serious	.
I	was	hesitant	to	include	this	in	my	presentation	because	this	cartoon	was	published	soon	after	9/11	.
What	was	,	for	me	,	a	very	naive	observation	,	turned	out	to	be	a	disaster	.
That	evening	,	I	came	home	to	hundreds	of	hate	mails	,	hundreds	of	people	telling	me	how	they	could	have	lived	another	day	without	seeing	this	.
I	was	also	asked	to	leave	the	organization	,	a	cartoonists	'	organization	in	America	,	that	for	me	was	my	lifeline	.
That	's	when	I	realized	,	you	know	,	cartoons	are	really	powerful	,	art	comes	with	responsibility	.
Anyway	,	what	I	did	was	I	decided	that	I	need	to	take	a	break	.
I	quit	my	job	at	the	papers	,	I	closed	my	school	,	and	I	wrapped	up	my	pencils	and	my	brushes	and	inks	,	and	I	decided	to	go	traveling	.
When	I	went	traveling	,	I	remember	,	I	met	this	fabulous	old	man	,	who	I	met	when	I	was	caricaturing	,	who	turned	out	to	be	an	artist	,	in	Italy	.
He	invited	me	to	his	studio	.	He	said	,	``	Come	and	visit	.	''
When	I	went	,	I	saw	the	ghastliest	thing	ever	.
I	saw	this	dead	,	naked	effigy	of	himself	hanging	from	the	ceiling	.
I	said	,	``	Oh	,	my	God	.	What	is	that	?	''
And	I	asked	him	,	and	he	said	,	``	Oh	,	that	thing	?	In	the	night	,	I	die	.
In	the	morning	,	I	am	born	again	.	''
I	thought	he	was	koo	koo	,	but	something	about	that	really	stuck	.
I	loved	it	.	I	thought	there	was	something	really	beautiful	about	that	.
So	I	said	,	``	I	am	dead	,	so	I	need	to	be	born	again	.	''
So	,	I	wanted	to	be	a	painter	like	him	,	except	,	I	do	n't	know	how	to	paint	.
So	,	I	tried	going	to	the	art	store	.
You	know	,	there	are	a	hundred	types	of	brushes	.
Forget	it	,	they	will	confuse	you	even	if	you	know	how	to	draw	.
So	I	decided	,	I	'm	going	to	learn	to	paint	by	myself	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	very	quick	clip	to	show	you	how	I	painted	and	a	little	bit	about	my	city	,	Bangalore	.
They	had	to	be	larger	than	life	.
Everything	had	to	be	larger	.	The	next	painting	was	even	bigger	.
And	even	bigger	.
And	for	me	it	was	,	I	had	to	dance	while	I	painted	.
It	was	so	exciting	.
Except	,	I	even	started	painting	dancers	.
Here	for	example	is	a	Flamenco	dancer	,	except	there	was	one	problem	.
I	did	n't	know	the	dance	form	,	so	I	started	following	them	,	and	I	made	some	money	,	sold	my	paintings	and	would	rush	off	to	France	or	Spain	and	work	with	them	.
That	's	Pepe	Linares	,	the	renowned	Flamenco	singer	.
But	I	had	one	problem	,	my	paintings	never	danced	.
As	much	energy	as	I	put	into	them	while	making	them	,	they	never	danced	.
So	I	decided	--	I	had	this	crazy	epiphany	at	two	in	the	morning	.
I	called	my	friends	,	painted	on	their	bodies	,	and	had	them	dance	in	front	of	a	painting	.
And	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	my	paintings	came	alive	.
And	then	I	was	fortunate	enough	to	actually	perform	this	in	California	with	Velocity	Circus	.
And	I	sat	like	you	guys	there	in	the	audience	.
And	I	saw	my	work	come	alive	.
You	know	,	normally	you	work	in	isolation	,	and	you	show	at	a	gallery	,	but	here	,	the	work	was	coming	alive	,	and	it	had	some	other	artists	working	with	me	.
The	collaborative	effort	was	fabulous	.
I	said	,	I	'm	going	to	collaborate	with	anybody	and	everybody	I	meet	.
I	started	doing	fashion	.
This	is	a	fashion	show	we	held	in	London	.
The	best	collaboration	,	of	course	,	is	with	children	.
They	are	ruthless	,	they	are	honest	,	but	they	're	full	of	energy	and	fun	.
This	is	a	work	,	a	library	I	designed	for	the	Robin	Hood	Foundation	.
And	I	must	say	,	I	spent	time	in	the	Bronx	working	with	these	kids	.
And	,	in	exchange	for	me	working	with	them	,	they	taught	me	how	to	be	cool	.
I	do	n't	think	I	've	succeeded	,	but	they	've	taught	me	.
They	said	,	``	Stop	saying	sorry	.	Say	,	my	bad	.	''
Then	I	said	,	all	this	is	good	,	but	I	want	to	paint	like	a	real	painter	.
American	education	is	so	expensive	.
I	was	in	India	,	and	I	was	walking	down	the	streets	,	and	I	saw	a	billboard	painter	.
And	these	guys	paint	humongous	paintings	,	and	they	look	really	good	.
And	I	wondered	how	they	did	it	from	so	close	.
So	,	one	day	I	had	the	opportunity	to	meet	one	of	these	guys	,	and	I	said	,	``	How	do	you	paint	like	that	?	Who	taught	you	?	''
And	he	said	,	``	Oh	,	it	's	very	easy	.	I	can	teach	you	,	but	we	're	leaving	the	city	,	because	billboard	painters	are	a	dying	,	extinct	bunch	of	artists	,	because	digital	printing	has	totally	replaced	them	and	hijacked	them	.	''
I	said	,	in	exchange	for	education	in	how	to	paint	,	I	will	support	them	,	and	I	started	a	company	.
And	since	then	,	I	've	been	painting	all	over	the	place	.
This	is	a	painting	I	did	of	my	wife	in	my	apartment	.
This	is	another	painting	.
And	,	in	fact	,	I	started	painting	on	anything	,	and	started	sending	them	around	town	.
Since	I	mentioned	my	wife	,	the	most	important	collaboration	has	been	with	her	,	Netra	.
Netra	and	I	met	when	she	was	18	.
I	must	have	been	19	and	a	half	then	,	and	it	was	love	at	first	sight	.
I	lived	in	India	.	She	lived	in	America	.
She	'd	come	every	two	months	to	visit	me	,	and	then	I	said	I	'm	the	man	,	I	'm	the	man	,	and	I	have	to	reciprocate	.
I	have	to	travel	seven	oceans	,	and	I	have	to	come	and	see	you	.
I	did	that	twice	,	and	I	went	broke	.
So	then	I	said	,	``	Nets	,	what	do	I	do	?	''
She	said	,	``	Why	do	n't	you	send	me	your	paintings	?
My	dad	knows	a	bunch	of	rich	guys	.
We	'll	try	and	con	them	into	buying	it	,	and	then	...	''
But	it	turned	out	,	after	I	sent	the	works	to	her	,	that	her	dad	's	friends	,	like	most	of	you	,	are	geeks	.
I	'm	joking	.
No	,	they	were	really	big	geeks	,	and	they	did	n't	know	much	about	art	.
So	Netra	was	stuck	with	30	paintings	of	mine	.
So	what	we	did	was	we	rented	a	little	van	and	we	drove	all	over	the	east	coast	trying	to	sell	it	.
She	contacted	anyone	and	everyone	who	was	willing	to	buy	my	work	.
She	made	enough	money	,	she	sold	off	the	whole	collection	and	made	enough	money	to	move	me	for	four	years	with	lawyers	,	a	company	,	everything	,	and	she	became	my	manager	.
That	's	us	in	New	York	.
Notice	one	thing	,	we	're	equal	here	.
Something	happened	along	the	line	.
But	this	brought	me	--	with	Netra	managing	my	career	--	it	brought	me	a	lot	of	success	.
I	was	really	happy	.	I	thought	of	myself	as	a	bit	of	a	rockstar	.
I	loved	the	attention	.
This	is	all	the	press	we	got	,	and	we	said	,	it	's	time	to	celebrate	.
And	I	said	that	the	best	way	to	celebrate	is	to	marry	Netra	.
I	said	,	``	Let	's	get	married	.	''
And	I	said	,	``	Not	just	married	.	Let	's	invite	everyone	who	's	helped	us	,	all	the	people	who	bought	our	work	.	''
And	you	wo	n't	believe	it	,	we	put	together	a	list	of	7,000	people	,	who	had	made	a	difference	--	a	ridiculous	list	,	but	I	was	determined	to	bring	them	to	India	,	so	--	a	lot	of	them	were	in	India	.
150	artists	volunteered	to	help	me	with	my	wedding	.
We	had	fashion	designers	,	installation	artists	,	models	,	we	had	makeup	artists	,	jewelry	designers	,	all	kinds	of	people	working	with	me	to	make	my	wedding	an	art	installation	.
And	I	had	a	special	installation	in	tribute	to	my	in-laws	.
I	had	the	vegetable	carvers	work	on	that	for	me	.
But	all	this	excitement	led	to	the	press	writing	about	us	.
We	were	in	the	papers	,	we	're	still	in	the	news	three	years	later	,	but	,	unfortunately	,	something	tragic	happened	right	after	.
My	mother	fell	very	ill	.
I	love	my	mother	and	I	was	told	all	of	a	sudden	that	she	was	going	to	die	.
And	they	said	you	have	to	say	bye	to	her	,	you	have	to	do	what	you	have	to	do	.
And	I	was	devastated	.
I	had	shows	booked	up	for	another	year	.
I	was	on	a	high	.
And	I	could	n't	.	I	could	not	.
My	life	was	not	exuberant	.
I	could	not	live	this	larger	than	life	person	.
I	started	exploring	the	darker	abscesses	of	the	human	mind	.
Of	course	,	my	work	turned	ugly	,	but	another	thing	happened	.
I	lost	all	my	audiences	.
The	Bollywood	stars	who	I	would	party	with	and	buy	my	work	disappeared	.
The	collectors	,	the	friends	,	the	press	,	everyone	said	,	``	Nice	,	but	thank	you	.	''
``	No	thank	you	,	''	was	more	like	it	.
But	I	wanted	people	to	actually	feel	my	work	from	their	gut	,	because	I	was	painting	it	from	my	gut	.
If	they	wanted	beauty	,	I	said	,	this	is	the	beauty	I	'm	willing	to	give	you	.	It	's	politicized	.
Of	course	,	none	of	them	liked	it	.
My	works	also	turned	autobiographical	.
At	this	point	,	something	else	happened	.
A	very	,	very	dear	friend	of	mine	came	out	of	the	closet	,	and	in	India	at	that	time	,	it	was	illegal	to	be	gay	,	and	it	's	disgusting	to	see	how	people	respond	to	a	gay	person	.
I	was	very	upset	.
I	remember	the	time	when	my	mother	used	to	dress	me	up	as	a	little	girl	--	that	's	me	there	--	because	she	wanted	a	girl	,	and	she	has	only	boys	.
Anyway	,	I	do	n't	know	what	my	friends	are	going	to	say	after	this	talk	.
It	's	a	secret	.
So	,	after	this	,	my	works	turned	a	little	violent	.
I	talked	about	this	masculinity	that	one	need	not	perform	.
And	I	talked	about	the	weakness	of	male	sexuality	.
This	time	,	not	only	did	my	collectors	disappear	,	the	political	activists	decided	to	ban	me	and	to	threaten	me	and	to	forbid	me	from	showing	.
It	turned	nasty	,	and	I	'm	a	bit	of	a	chicken	.
I	ca	n't	deal	with	any	threat	.	This	was	a	big	threat	.
So	,	I	decided	it	was	time	to	end	and	go	back	home	.
This	time	I	said	let	's	try	something	different	.
I	need	to	be	reborn	again	.
And	I	thought	the	best	way	,	as	most	of	you	know	who	have	children	,	the	best	way	to	have	a	new	lease	on	life	,	is	to	have	a	child	.
I	decided	to	have	a	child	,	and	before	I	did	that	,	I	quickly	studied	what	can	go	wrong	.
How	can	a	family	get	dysfunctional	?
And	Rudra	was	born	.
That	's	my	little	son	.
And	two	magical	things	happened	after	he	was	born	.
My	mother	miraculously	recovered	after	a	serious	operation	,	and	this	man	was	elected	president	of	this	country	.
You	know	I	sat	at	home	and	I	watched	.
I	teared	up	and	I	said	that	's	where	I	want	to	be	.
So	Netra	and	I	wound	up	our	life	,	closed	up	everything	we	had	,	and	we	decided	to	move	to	New	York	.
And	this	was	just	eight	months	ago	.
I	moved	back	to	New	York	,	my	work	has	changed	.
Everything	about	my	work	has	become	more	whimsical	.
This	one	is	called	``	What	the	Fuck	Was	I	Thinking	?	''
It	talks	about	mental	incest	.
You	know	,	I	may	appear	to	be	a	very	nice	,	clean	,	sweet	boy	.
But	I	'm	not	.	I	'm	capable	of	thinking	anything	.
But	I	'm	very	civil	in	my	action	,	I	assure	you	.
These	are	just	different	cartoons	.
And	,	before	I	go	,	I	want	to	tell	you	a	little	story	.
I	was	talking	to	mother	and	father	this	morning	,	and	my	dad	said	,	``	I	know	you	have	so	much	you	want	to	say	,	but	you	have	to	talk	about	your	work	with	children	.	''
So	I	said	,	okay	.
I	work	with	children	all	over	the	world	,	and	that	's	an	entirely	different	talk	,	but	I	want	to	leave	you	with	one	story	that	really	,	really	inspired	me	.
I	met	Belinda	when	she	was	16	.
I	was	17	.
I	was	in	Australia	,	and	Belinda	had	cancer	,	and	I	was	told	she	's	not	going	to	live	very	long	.
They	,	in	fact	,	told	me	three	weeks	.
I	walk	into	her	room	,	and	there	was	a	shy	girl	,	and	she	was	bald	,	and	she	was	trying	to	hide	her	baldness	.
I	whipped	out	my	pen	,	and	I	started	drawing	on	her	head	and	I	drew	a	crown	for	her	.
And	then	,	we	started	talking	,	and	we	spent	a	lovely	time	--	I	told	her	how	I	ended	up	in	Australia	,	how	I	backpacked	and	who	I	conned	,	and	how	I	got	a	ticket	,	and	all	the	stories	.
And	I	drew	it	out	for	her	.
And	then	I	left	.
Belinda	died	and	within	a	few	days	of	her	death	,	they	published	a	book	for	her	,	and	she	used	my	cartoon	on	the	cover	.
And	she	wrote	a	little	note	,	she	said	,	``	Hey	Rags	,	thank	you	for	the	magic	carpet	ride	around	the	world	.	''
For	me	,	my	art	is	my	magic	carpet	ride	.
I	hope	you	will	join	me	in	this	magic	carpet	ride	,	and	touch	children	and	be	honest	.
Thank	you	so	much	.

Lisa	Gansky	:	The	future	of	business	is	the	``	mesh	''
I	'm	speaking	to	you	about	what	I	call	the	``	mesh	.	''
It	's	essentially	a	fundamental	shift	in	our	relationship	with	stuff	,	with	the	things	in	our	lives	.
And	it	's	starting	to	look	at	--	not	always	and	not	for	everything	--	but	in	certain	moments	of	time	,	access	to	certain	kinds	of	goods	and	service	will	trump	ownership	of	them	.
And	so	it	's	the	pursuit	of	better	things	,	easily	shared	.
And	we	come	from	a	long	tradition	of	sharing	.
We	've	shared	transportation	.
We	've	shared	wine	and	food	and	other	sorts	of	fabulous	experiences	in	coffee	bars	in	Amsterdam	.
We	've	also	shared	other	sorts	of	entertainment	--	sports	arenas	,	public	parks	,	concert	halls	,	libraries	,	universities	.
All	these	things	are	share-platforms	,	but	sharing	ultimately	starts	and	ends	with	what	I	refer	to	as	the	``	mother	of	all	share-platforms	.	''
And	as	I	think	about	the	mesh	and	I	think	about	,	well	,	what	's	driving	it	,	how	come	it	's	happening	now	,	I	think	there	's	a	number	of	vectors	that	I	want	to	give	you	as	background	.
One	is	the	recession	--	that	the	recession	has	caused	us	to	rethink	our	relationship	with	the	things	in	our	lives	relative	to	the	value	--	so	starting	to	align	the	value	with	the	true	cost	.
Secondly	,	population	growth	and	density	into	cities	.
More	people	,	smaller	spaces	,	less	stuff	.
Climate	change	:	we	're	trying	to	reduce	the	stress	in	our	personal	lives	and	in	our	communities	and	on	the	planet	.
Also	,	there	's	been	this	recent	distrust	of	big	brands	,	global	big	brands	,	in	a	bunch	of	different	industries	,	and	that	's	created	an	opening	.
Research	is	showing	here	,	in	the	States	,	and	in	Canada	and	Western	Europe	,	that	most	of	us	are	much	more	open	to	local	companies	,	or	brands	that	maybe	we	have	n't	heard	of	.
Whereas	before	,	we	went	with	the	big	brands	that	we	were	sure	we	trusted	.
And	last	is	that	we	're	more	connected	now	to	more	people	on	the	planet	than	ever	before	--	except	for	if	you	're	sitting	next	to	someone	.
The	other	thing	that	's	worth	considering	is	that	we	've	made	a	huge	investment	over	decades	and	decades	,	and	tens	of	billions	of	dollars	have	gone	into	this	investment	that	now	is	our	inheritance	.
It	's	a	physical	infrastructure	that	allows	us	to	get	from	point	A	to	point	B	and	move	things	that	way	.
It	's	also	--	Web	and	mobile	allow	us	to	be	connected	and	create	all	kinds	of	platforms	and	systems	,	and	the	investment	of	those	technologies	and	that	infrastructure	is	really	our	inheritance	.
It	allows	us	to	engage	in	really	new	and	interesting	ways	.
And	so	for	me	,	a	mesh	company	,	the	``	classic	''	mesh	company	,	brings	together	these	three	things	:	our	ability	to	connect	to	each	other	--	most	of	us	are	walking	around	with	these	mobile	devices	that	are	GPS-enabled	and	Web-enabled	--	allows	us	to	find	each	other	and	find	things	in	time	and	space	.
And	third	is	that	physical	things	are	readable	on	a	map	--	so	restaurants	,	a	variety	of	venues	,	but	also	with	GPS	and	other	technology	like	RFID	and	it	continues	to	expand	beyond	that	,	we	can	also	track	things	that	are	moving	,	like	a	car	,	a	taxicab	,	a	transit	system	,	a	box	that	's	moving	through	time	and	space	.
And	so	that	sets	up	for	making	access	to	get	goods	and	services	more	convenient	and	less	costly	in	many	cases	than	owning	them	.
For	example	,	I	want	to	use	Zipcar	.
How	many	people	here	have	experienced	car-sharing	or	bike-sharing	?
Wow	,	that	's	great	.	Okay	,	thank	you	.
is	the	largest	car-sharing	company	in	the	world	.
They	did	not	invent	car-sharing	.
Car-sharing	was	actually	invented	in	Europe	.
One	of	the	founders	went	to	Switzerland	,	saw	it	implemented	someplace	,	said	,	``	Wow	,	that	looks	really	cool	.
I	think	we	can	do	that	in	Cambridge	,	''	brought	it	to	Cambridge	and	they	started	--	two	women	--	Robin	Chase	being	the	other	person	who	started	it	.
Zipcar	got	some	really	important	things	right	.
First	,	they	really	understood	that	a	brand	is	a	voice	and	a	product	is	a	souvenir	.
And	so	they	were	very	clever	about	the	way	that	they	packaged	car-sharing	.
They	made	it	sexy	.	They	made	it	fresh	.
They	made	it	aspirational	.
If	you	were	a	member	of	the	club	,	when	you	're	a	member	of	a	club	,	you	're	a	Zipster	.
The	cars	they	picked	did	n't	look	like	ex-cop	cars	that	were	hollowed	out	or	something	.
They	picked	these	sexy	cars	.
They	targeted	to	universities	.
They	made	sure	that	the	demographic	for	who	they	were	targeting	and	the	car	was	all	matching	.
It	was	a	very	nice	experience	,	and	the	cars	were	clean	and	reliable	,	and	it	all	worked	.
And	so	from	a	branding	perspective	,	they	got	a	lot	right	.
But	they	understood	fundamentally	that	they	are	not	a	car	company	.
They	understand	that	they	are	an	information	company	.
Because	when	we	buy	a	car	we	go	to	the	dealer	once	,	we	have	an	interaction	,	and	we	're	chow	--	usually	as	quickly	as	possible	.
But	when	you	're	sharing	a	car	and	you	have	a	car-share	service	,	you	might	use	an	E.V	.	to	commute	,	you	get	a	truck	because	you	're	doing	a	home	project	.
When	you	pick	your	aunt	up	at	the	airport	,	you	get	a	sedan	.
And	you	're	going	to	the	mountains	to	ski	,	you	get	different	accessories	put	on	the	car	for	doing	that	sort	of	thing	.
Meanwhile	,	these	guys	are	sitting	back	,	collecting	all	sorts	of	data	about	our	behavior	and	how	we	interact	with	the	service	.
And	so	it	's	not	only	an	option	for	them	,	but	I	believe	it	's	an	imperative	for	Zipcar	and	other	mesh	companies	to	actually	just	wow	us	,	to	be	like	a	concierge	service	.
Because	we	give	them	so	much	information	,	and	they	are	entitled	to	really	see	how	it	is	that	we	're	moving	.
They	're	in	really	good	shape	to	anticipate	what	we	're	going	to	want	next	.
And	so	what	percent	of	the	day	do	you	think	the	average	person	uses	a	car	?
What	percentage	of	the	time	?
Any	guesses	?
Those	are	really	very	good	.
I	was	imagining	it	was	like	20	percent	when	I	first	started	.
The	number	across	the	U.S.	and	Western	Europe	is	eight	percent	.
And	so	basically	even	if	you	think	it	's	10	percent	,	90	percent	of	the	time	,	something	that	costs	us	a	lot	of	money	--	personally	,	and	also	we	organize	our	cities	around	it	and	all	sorts	of	things	--	90	percent	of	the	time	it	's	sitting	around	.
So	for	this	reason	,	I	think	one	of	the	other	themes	with	the	mesh	is	essentially	that	,	if	we	squeeze	hard	on	things	that	we	've	thrown	away	,	there	's	a	lot	of	value	in	those	things	.
What	set	up	with	Zipcar	--	Zipcar	started	in	2000	.
In	the	last	year	,	2010	,	two	car	companies	started	,	one	that	's	in	the	U.K.	called	WhipCar	,	and	the	other	one	,	RelayRides	,	in	the	U.S	.
They	're	both	peer-to-peer	car-sharing	services	,	because	the	two	things	that	really	work	for	car-sharing	is	,	one	,	the	car	has	to	be	available	,	and	two	,	it	's	within	one	or	two	blocks	of	where	you	stand	.
Well	the	car	that	's	one	or	two	blocks	from	your	home	or	your	office	is	probably	your	neighbor	's	car	,	and	it	's	probably	also	available	.
So	people	have	created	this	business	.
Zipcar	started	a	decade	earlier	,	in	2000	.
It	took	them	six	years	to	get	1,000	cars	in	service	.
WhipCar	,	which	started	April	of	last	year	,	it	took	them	six	months	to	get	1,000	cars	in	the	service	.
So	,	really	interesting	.
People	are	making	anywhere	between	200	and	700	dollars	a	month	letting	their	neighbors	use	their	car	when	they	're	not	using	it	.
So	it	's	like	vacation	rentals	for	cars	.
Since	I	'm	here	--	and	I	hope	some	people	in	the	audience	are	in	the	car	business	--	--	I	'm	thinking	that	,	coming	from	the	technology	side	of	things	--	we	saw	cable-ready	TVs	and	WiFi-ready	Notebooks	--	it	would	be	really	great	if	,	any	minute	now	,	you	guys	could	start	rolling	share-ready	cars	off	.
Because	it	just	creates	more	flexibility	.
It	allows	us	as	owners	to	have	other	options	.
And	I	think	we	're	going	there	anyway	.
The	opportunity	and	the	challenge	with	mesh	businesses	--	and	those	are	businesses	like	Zipcar	or	Netflix	that	are	full	mesh	businesses	,	or	other	ones	where	you	have	a	lot	of	the	car	companies	,	car	manufacturers	,	who	are	beginning	to	offer	their	own	car-share	services	as	well	as	a	second	flanker	brand	,	or	as	really	a	test	,	I	think	--	is	to	make	sharing	irresistible	.
We	have	experiences	in	our	lives	,	certainly	,	when	sharing	has	been	irresistible	.
It	's	just	,	how	do	we	make	that	recurrent	and	scale	it	?
We	know	also	,	because	we	're	connected	in	social	networks	,	that	it	's	easy	to	create	delight	in	one	little	place	.
It	's	contagious	because	we	're	all	connected	to	each	other	.
So	if	I	have	a	terrific	experience	and	I	tweet	it	,	or	I	tell	five	people	standing	next	to	me	,	news	travels	.
The	opposite	,	as	we	know	,	is	also	true	,	often	more	true	.
So	here	we	have	LudoTruck	,	which	is	in	L.A.	,	doing	the	things	that	gourmet	food	trucks	do	,	and	they	've	gathered	quite	a	following	.
In	general	,	and	maybe	,	again	,	it	's	because	I	'm	a	tech	entrepreneur	,	I	look	at	things	as	platforms	.
Platforms	are	invitations	.
So	creating	Craigslist	or	iTunes	and	the	iPhone	developer	network	,	there	are	all	these	networks	--	Facebook	as	well	.
These	platforms	invite	all	sorts	of	developers	and	all	sorts	of	people	to	come	with	their	ideas	and	their	opportunity	to	create	and	target	an	application	for	a	particular	audience	.
And	honestly	,	it	's	full	of	surprises	.
Because	I	do	n't	think	any	of	us	in	this	room	could	have	predicted	the	sorts	of	applications	that	have	happened	at	Facebook	,	around	Facebook	,	for	example	,	two	years	ago	,	when	Mark	announced	that	they	were	going	to	go	with	a	platform	.
So	in	this	way	,	I	think	that	cities	are	platforms	,	and	certainly	Detroit	is	a	platform	.
The	invitation	of	bringing	makers	and	artists	and	entrepreneurs	--	it	really	helps	stimulate	this	fiery	creativity	and	helps	a	city	to	thrive	.
It	's	inviting	participation	,	and	cities	have	,	historically	,	invited	all	sorts	of	participation	.
Now	we	're	saying	that	there	's	other	options	as	well	.
So	,	for	example	,	city	departments	can	open	up	transit	data	.
Google	has	made	available	transit	data	API	.
And	so	there	's	about	seven	or	eight	cities	already	in	the	U.S	.
that	have	provided	the	transit	data	,	and	different	developers	are	building	applications	.
So	I	was	having	a	coffee	in	Portland	,	and	half-of-a-latte	in	and	the	little	board	in	the	cafe	all	of	a	sudden	starts	showing	me	that	the	next	bus	is	coming	in	three	minutes	and	the	train	is	coming	in	16	minutes	.
And	so	it	's	reliable	,	real	data	that	's	right	in	my	face	,	where	I	am	,	so	I	can	finish	the	latte	.
There	's	this	fabulous	opportunity	we	have	across	the	U.S.	now	:	about	21	percent	of	vacant	commercial	and	industrial	space	.
That	space	is	not	vital	.
The	areas	around	it	lack	vitality	and	vibrancy	and	engagement	.
There	's	this	thing	--	how	many	people	here	have	heard	of	pop-up	stores	or	pop-up	shops	?
Oh	,	great	.	So	I	'm	a	big	fan	of	this	.
And	this	is	a	very	mesh-y	thing	.
Essentially	,	there	are	all	sorts	of	restaurants	in	Oakland	,	near	where	I	live	.
There	's	a	pop-up	general	store	every	three	weeks	,	and	they	do	a	fantastic	job	of	making	a	very	social	event	happening	for	foodies	.
Super	fun	,	and	it	happens	in	a	very	transitional	neighborhood	.
Subsequent	to	that	,	after	it	's	been	going	for	about	a	year	now	,	they	actually	started	to	lease	and	create	and	extend	.
An	area	that	was	edgy-artsy	is	now	starting	to	become	much	cooler	and	engage	a	lot	more	people	.
So	this	is	an	example	.
The	Crafty	Fox	is	this	woman	who	's	into	crafts	,	and	she	does	these	pop-up	crafts	fairs	around	London	.
But	these	sorts	of	things	are	happening	in	many	different	environments	.
From	my	perspective	,	one	of	the	things	pop-up	stores	do	is	create	perishability	and	urgency	.
It	creates	two	of	the	favorite	words	of	any	businessperson	:	sold	out	.
And	the	opportunity	to	really	focus	trust	and	attention	is	a	wonderful	thing	.
So	a	lot	of	what	we	see	in	the	mesh	,	and	a	lot	of	what	we	have	in	the	platform	that	we	built	allows	us	to	define	,	refine	and	scale	.
It	allows	us	to	test	things	as	an	entrepreneur	,	to	go	to	market	,	to	be	in	conversation	with	people	,	listen	,	refine	something	and	go	back	.
It	's	very	cost-effective	,	and	it	's	very	mesh-y	.
The	infrastructure	enables	that	.
In	closing	,	and	as	we	're	moving	towards	the	end	,	I	just	also	want	to	encourage	--	and	I	'm	willing	to	share	my	failures	as	well	,	though	not	from	the	stage	.
I	would	just	like	to	say	that	one	of	the	big	things	,	when	we	look	at	waste	and	when	we	look	at	ways	that	we	can	really	be	generous	and	contribute	to	each	other	,	but	also	move	to	create	a	better	economic	situation	and	a	better	environmental	situation	,	is	by	sharing	failures	.
And	one	quick	example	is	Velib	,	in	2007	,	came	forward	in	Paris	with	a	very	bold	proposition	,	a	very	big	bike-sharing	service	.
They	made	a	lot	of	mistakes	.
They	had	some	number	of	big	successes	.
But	they	were	very	transparent	,	or	they	had	to	be	,	in	the	way	that	they	exposed	what	worked	and	did	n't	work	.
And	so	B.C	.	in	Barcelona	and	B-cycle	and	Boris	Bikes	in	London	--	no	one	has	had	to	repeat	the	version	1.0	screw-ups	and	expensive	learning	exercises	that	happened	in	Paris	.
So	the	opportunity	when	we	're	connected	is	also	to	share	failures	and	successes	.
We	're	at	the	very	beginning	of	something	that	,	what	we	're	seeing	and	the	way	that	mesh	companies	are	coming	forward	,	is	inviting	,	it	's	engaging	,	but	it	's	very	early	.
I	have	a	website	--	it	's	a	directory	--	and	it	started	with	about	1,200	companies	,	and	in	the	last	two-and-a-half	months	it	's	up	to	about	3,300	companies	.
And	it	grows	on	a	very	regular	daily	basis	.
But	it	's	very	much	at	the	beginning	.
So	I	just	want	to	welcome	all	of	you	onto	the	ride	.
And	thank	you	very	much	.

JR	's	TED	Prize	wish	:	Use	art	to	turn	the	world	inside	out
Two	weeks	ago	I	was	in	my	studio	in	Paris	,	and	the	phone	rang	and	I	heard	,	``	Hey	,	JR	,	you	won	the	TED	Prize	2011	.
You	have	to	make	a	wish	to	save	the	world	.	''
I	was	lost	.
I	mean	,	I	ca	n't	save	the	world	.	Nobody	can	.
The	world	is	fucked	up	.
Come	on	,	you	have	dictators	ruling	the	world	,	population	is	growing	by	millions	,	there	's	no	more	fish	in	the	sea	,	the	North	Pole	is	melting	and	as	the	last	TED	Prize	winner	said	,	we	're	all	becoming	fat	.
Except	maybe	French	people	.
Whatever	.
So	I	called	back	and	I	told	her	,	``	Look	,	Amy	,	tell	the	TED	guys	I	just	wo	n't	show	up	.
I	ca	n't	do	anything	to	save	the	world	.	''
She	said	,	``	Hey	,	JR	,	your	wish	is	not	to	save	the	world	,	but	to	change	the	world	.	''
``	Oh	,	all	right	.	''
``	That	's	cool	.	''
I	mean	,	technology	,	politics	,	business	do	change	the	world	--	not	always	in	a	good	way	,	but	they	do	.
What	about	art	?
Could	art	change	the	world	?
